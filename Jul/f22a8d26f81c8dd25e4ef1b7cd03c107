JOHANNESBURG: The Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) said while it was pleased that justice had been served in the Tshegofatso Pule murder case, it was concerned about how long it took the courts to finalise gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) cases. On Friday, Acting Judge Stuart Wilson sentenced Ntuthuko Shoba to life imprisonment for the brutal June 2020 murder of the heavily pregnant Pule and her unborn child. The 28-year-old Soweto woman's pregnant body was found hanging from a tree in Durban Deep, Roodepoort, by Tshepo Bodibe, a resident. Shoba, who was engaged to another woman and had been having an affair with Pule, hired Muzikayise Malephane to kill Pule. “The life sentence handed to Ntuthuko Shoba for the 2020 murder of Tshegofatso Pule is a welcome step that signals the willingness of the judicial system to combat GBVF,” said the CGE. The commission said that although it was pleased that justice had been served, Pule’s family had to wait for two years for this conclusion. “The commission’s court-monitoring processes over the years have discovered mounting frustration as the justice system continues to be plagued by deeply embedded systemic constraints such as poor investigative capacity by the police, absence of crucial witnesses leading to cases collapsing due to lack of evidence, frequent changes of prosecutorial teams, failure to set court dates on time and many other factors,” the CGE said. It added that it was aware of the policies, procedures and legislative frameworks put in place by the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development to ensure an effective administration of justice. “Yet these systemic constraints continue to undermine the policy intentions,” the commission said. The CGE called on the Justice Cluster to prioritise GBVF cases and address these systemic challenges in the administration of justice. The Star
