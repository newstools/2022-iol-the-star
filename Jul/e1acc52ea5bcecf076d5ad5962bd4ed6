Richard Mdluli has been placed on parole. This does not mean he is a free man because he will be subjected to supervision until his sentence expires. Mdluli was sentenced to five years imprisonment for kidnapping, assault, and intimidation on September 29, 2020. Today, Correctional Services Department confirmed that offender Mdluli has been placed on parole, effectively from Tuesday. “He qualified to be considered for Parole Placement after serving a 1/3 of the sentence as he falls under the Phaahla Judgment regime (crimes committed before October 1, 2004). It is critical to highlight that the crimes he was found guilty of were committed on October 23, 1998,” said Department of Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo. Nxumalo said the Minimum Detention Period (MDP) for Mdluli was on May 28 this year, but he could not be considered for parole placement at the time due to a pending court case. He said that subsequently, Mdluli was given bail of R10 000 which was paid in full on June 28, thus paving the way for his parole consideration process to proceed. “This decision was taken by the Correctional Supervision and Parole Board, having assessed Mdluli’s profile and other material submitted for the purposes of parole consideration. He will complete the remainder of the sentence in the system of community corrections, whereby he is expected to comply with specific set of conditions and will be subjected to supervision until his sentence expires,” Nxumalo said. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
