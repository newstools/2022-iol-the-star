The popular drama series, UBettina Wethu will be making a return to the screens for a thrilling Season 2 that will broadcast on SABC 1 from Monday August 15 at 7.30pm and Viu AVOD at the same time. Viewers at home can also look forward to seeing this drama every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at the same time weekly. The new season follows Betty in her new leadership position as the accounts manager at Nubia where she will face new moral dilemmas and learn to make hard decisions that affect people she knows and loves. This includes “Dipudi” as well as those that want to see her “stay in place” like Brandon, Lakhe and Tbang. The world currently has quite a number of Bettys but South Africa and the rest of Africa are about to meet Betty number 21 who undoubtedly will bring a glittering glow up to our screens in this new season, portrayed by Kamogelo Molatlhoe. Chief executive of Known Associates Entertainment, Chikapa Phiri, said they were elated to be bringing back a fresh season and looked forward to intriguing the audience. “We had to consider on-screen chemistry, for our new Betty, when Lunga and Kamo came together on screen we realised it was magic at first sight,” said the series producer Tshepiso Chikapa-Phiri. “After working hard to bring back this family favourite to South African TV screens, we’re thrilled to announce season two of uBettina Wethu. We trust that our viewers who journeyed with us during the first season will be back for more provoking content and good laughter, and we look forward to enthralling our new audiences.  “Partnership is the foundation of the success of uBettina Wethu. Known Associates is proud to announce our collaboration with Standard Bank, a financial institution committed to financial education and AMKA, a cosmetic giant who returns having partnered with (us) on season 1 thus complementing the continued support of our anchor broadcasting partners Viu South Africa and the SABC,” said Phiri.
