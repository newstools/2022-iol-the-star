Johannesburg – The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has called on the public to help in cleaning South African rivers during Nelson Mandela month as part of its annual Clear River Campaign. Annually, the DWS celebrates the Clean River Campaign in a bid to clean up and protect South Africa’s water resources. The department said that under the theme, “South Africa is a water source country, clean up and protect our water resources”, the campaign aims on actively engaging communities as well as promoting and creating an on-going awareness and education on protecting our water resources among communities, municipalities, government departments and industries such as mining and agriculture, which are major sources of water pollution. “This proactive approach is greatly encouraged to protect rivers, streams, wetlands and other water ecosystems, given the drought that still persists in large parts of the country,” the DWS said. The campaign has called on people to dedicate their 67 minutes of goodwill activities on Mandela Day (July 18) towards cleaning up streams, wetlands, dams, canals and any freshwater source. “During the Clear River Campaign, people should bear witness to the value of clean water, especially for their healthy development as rivers perform functions such as the ability to clean itself best when it is healthy.  “Therefore, active and responsible citizenry is encouraged across the spectrum, where people from all walks of life become participants in promoting healthy rivers.  “The relationship between communities and healthy rivers can never be overstated, as it is community members who must take care of our rivers to ensure that they are not filtered with filthy litter,” the DWS said. According to the departmental spokesperson, Mr Sputnik Ratau, members of the public are encouraged to take a stand and create platforms, share concerns and respond to incidences of river pollution by cleaning their rivers and report any irregular activities leading to water pollution such as illegal dumping.
