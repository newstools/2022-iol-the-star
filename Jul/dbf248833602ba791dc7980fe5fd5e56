Popular musician Berita found herself having to ask for forgiveness from Mihlali Ndamase, after her estranged husband Nota Baloyi made openly insensitive comments about the influencer. Baloyi, who frequently trends for his harsh remarks about women, was at it again as he objectified Ndamase on a public platform. In a video doing the rounds on social media, he said while there were men who found her desirable, he could buy Ndamase because she was for sale. “There are some guys who think that Mihlali is attractive and all I think is ningamuthenga (I could buy her). And they don’t understand that if Mihlali is for sale, that means she’s an object, which means that you can kill her if you want to. It’s like buying a dog. You can put it down,” said Baloyi This triggered a furore, and Baloyi was labelled a misogynist for consistently bashing women unapologetically and needlessly. His ex-wife Berita came out and opened up about the toxicity of their marriage, revealing that she left their marital home in January. In a thread of posts, she apologised to Mihlali, saying no woman deserved to be reduced to an object as Baloyi had done. “Mihlali mntase uxolo. I apologize to you. I do not condone such things said by Nota to you. No woman should ever be objectified and ripped apart publicly or privately.” She further spoke about the bullying and disgrace she had to bare publicly and privately claiming it has been painful. “This man's irrational behavior is beyond me. I am a very reasonable person. I will be the first to admit it. I missed very big red flags. The day I decided to leave my marriage. Is the day I had to choose. Between being married and being alive.” Ndamase responded to the tweet, saying: “Thank you for the tweet, I appreciate it. You honestly did not have to. His words and actions aren't  a reflection of you.”
