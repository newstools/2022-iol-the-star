SIYABONGA SITHOLE The National Prosecuting Authority says it welcomes the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court sentence against former SA Airways chairperson Dudu Myeni, who was yesterday (Wed) fined R120 000 with half of the fine suspended for five years. Myeni was found guilty of obstruction of justice after she named a protected witness at the Commission of Inquiry into state capture. The court ruled that Myeni pay a R120 000 fine or face two years in prison, with half of the money suspended for five years. This is after the former chairperson of the country's embattled airline had identified a witness by the name of 'Mr X' despite having been warned by the chairperson of the commission and current chief Justice, Raymond Zondo at the recently concluded commission not to name the witness. The court argued that Myeni has disclosed the identity of the witness more than once which resulted in the charge of obstructing justice being brought against her. The court ruled that Myeni pay the first instalment of R30 000 immediately, which she has paid, with the second instalment of R30 000 expected to be paid on or before August 29, 2022, while the remaining portion was suspended. Her lawyer, Nqabayethu Buthelezi, in mitigation of sentence, had argued that Myeni is nearing old age and was not gainfully employed as she last had an income in 2017, adding that Myeni had since been declared a “delinquent director” which in turn prevented her from being employed or being in business. Gauteng NPA spokesperson, Phindu Mjonondwane said the prosecuting authority and the respondent had entered into a plea agreement with the state which resulted in the agreement on the suitable fine. "Both parties have agreed that this is a just sentence that strikes a balance between the interest of justice, the seriousness of the offence and the interests of the accused. We believe that the decision gives effect to the principle of equality of the law, and as NPA, we welcome this decision," she said.
