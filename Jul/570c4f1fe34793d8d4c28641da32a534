SIYABONGA SITHOLE The DA says it has launched a petition calling for Tembisa Hospital CFO, Lerato Madyo, to be suspended and investigated for "fishy" payments to companies linked to the ANC Ekurhuleni treasurer general, Sello Sekhokho. The party says shortly before she was murdered, whistle-blower, Babita Doekaran had sounded alarm bells of corruption at the hospital following payments of hospital money to three companies belonging to Sekhokho. DA spokesperson on health, Jack Bloom, says the petition calls for a forensic investigation into the R100 million worth of fishy payments made by Madyo to companies belonging to Sekhokho and that the CFO be urgently suspended following these dodgy payments. Bloom said the DA will be seeking answers to these issues before the Gauteng legislature for the cover-up on the Tembisa Hospital payments. "People are dying in our public hospitals because of massive corruption and wastage of money," Bloom said. Bloom added that Madyo was made permanent CFO even though her track record was questionable. "Lerato Madyo was acting CFO last year and was recently appointed as permanent CFO despite a poor record with late payments to suppliers.  “I will be asking questions in the Gauteng Legislature about an apparent cover-up of the Tembisa Hospital payments and what is being done to investigate their possible to Deokaran's murder,” Bloom said.
