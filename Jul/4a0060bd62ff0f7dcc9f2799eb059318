Johannesburg: The police in Mpumalanga have registered an inquest after two sets of twins, aged 8 and 13, were killed in a shack fire at Marikana Informal Settlement in Hendrina in the early hours of Monday. Mpumalanga SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the police were saddened by the incident. He said police were called to the scene where a shack was on fire at Marikana Informal Settlement. “On their arrival, they indeed found that (the information) was true and as a result, the firefighters were also called to extinguish the fire. Unfortunately, two sets of twins (two boys and two girls) were certified dead,” Mohlala said. The police said that although the cause of the blaze had not been confirmed, loose cables were visible on the ground, prompting a suspicion that there might have been an illegal electricity connection. “It is further alleged that the 33-year-old mother of the deceased left them three days ago in the care of their 17-year-old brother. When the fire broke out, the brother tried to save the lives of his siblings but couldn't as the fire was at an advanced stage,” Mohlala said. The traumatised mother and 17-year-old were taken to hospital in Middelburg as they were in shock. The SAPS confirmed that it had registered an inquest and the investigation was ongoing. The Star
