The South African Communist Party (SACP) outgoing general secretary Dr Blade Nzimande is stepping down from the position after being there for 24 years, he made it clear that he is not leaving the party or politics. The SACP’s 15th National Conference got under-way in Boksburg, Ekurhuleni on Wednesday morning, Nzimande, one of the longest serving SACP general secretary’s is handing over the reins at the current National Congress. He took over the position from Charles Nqakula at the 1998 conference. It is believed that Nzimande’s first deputy, Solly Mapaila, is likely to be his successor. Nzimande said it's time to step down from the position but not from the SACP. “I am definitely stepping down as general secretary of the SACP. This month, I can’t remember the exact date. I was elected general secretary 24 years ago. That is a very long time. In fact, other than Moses Kotane, who is the longest-serving general secretary of the SACP, other than him, I’m the longest serving. I thought perhaps it’s time for a new general secretary to take over,” said Nzimande. He said since taking over, the party had achieved tremendously, saying that he doesn’t think they were more than 10 000 members when he became general secretary. “We are now at over 330 000 members within a 24-year period, which is a huge and significant growth for a Communist Party. I think I am proud of stepping down, leaving an SACP that has got a significant membership,” Nzimande. When asked about Mapaila being his successor, Nzimande said it was not his choice but the choice of Congress, but said if one asked him,  Mapaila is definitely more than capable. Nzimande said if the SACP membership said he should be available for the position if chairperson, he is available because he is not leaving the SACP. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
