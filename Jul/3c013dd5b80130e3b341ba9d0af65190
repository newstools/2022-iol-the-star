More than 350 000 Grade 1 and 8 online admissions applications have been successfully processed since the start of the application period on July 22. The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) announced that as of Monday, a total of 350 207 Grade 1 and 8 online admissions applications had been successfully processed, with a total of 151 949 applications made for Grade 1 and 198 258 applications made for Grade 8. “We are pleased at the progress our system has made in processing a large amount of applications. Indeed, improvement introduced to the system played a significant role in smooth running of the system. Parents and guardians can reach out to us on our respective platforms if they need assistance with applying,” said Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi. GDE spokesperson Steve Mabona said on July 22 the department’s call centre received an average of 1 700 calls per hour related to the 2023 online admissions and about 350 calls per hour on Monday. He added that on Friday, the GDE WhatsApp line received about 3 200 messages, while on Monday about 7 200 enquiries were recorded. “Accordingly, all these enquiries were efficiently managed by our team. It looks like the WhatsApp line is a game changer as more people prefer sending their enquiries through that medium,” Mabona said. The 2023 online admissions application period for Grades 1 and 8 is expected to close on August 19 at midnight. The department urged all parents to either submit certified copies of the required documentation to the schools they applied to, or upload the documents onto the online admissions system, but applicants may not submit both at schools and online. “Applicants who may not have internet access or the resources required to apply can visit their nearest district office or our decentralised walk-In centres to be assisted,” Mabona said. @Chulu_M
