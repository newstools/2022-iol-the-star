JOHANNESBURG- The reduced severity of Covid-19, with the repealing of Covid-19 restrictions, has prompted the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) to review reporting structures. For more than two years, the NICD, a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, has been diligently reporting Covid-19 surveillance data on a daily basis. The NICD announced that, however, the current phase of the pandemic had necessitated the review of reporting structures. “As of 9 July, 2022, the NICD will no longer be reporting Covid-19 surveillance data over weekends. The reporting of data will resume on Mondays to Fridays, while aggregate reports for the weekend period will be released on Mondays, or the next weekday following a public holiday,” the organisation said. On Friday, the NICD reported 365 new Covid-19 cases that have been identified in South Africa and eight deaths, and of these, three occurred in the past 24-48 hours. The NICD thanked stakeholders and the public for their ongoing support and interest. The Star
