SIYABONGA SITHOLE Power Cuts caused by the Eskom crisis had cost Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital over R3. 4 million in diesel costs, the DA spokesperson for health in Gauteng, Jack Bloom, said in a statement. Bloom said this was a sharp increase from the previous years due to the unprecedented levels of power supply instability, adding that the figure was revealed by Gauteng MEC of health Nomathemba Mokgethi in a written response to the DA's questions at the Gauteng Provincial legislature. Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital has spent R3.4 million on diesel for its emergency generators so far this year, a sharp increase from previous years due to the latest electricity cuts. Bloom said last year the hospital spent R2.63 million on diesel for its 20 generators, and the previous year only R321 000. "All the generators are being serviced, with 12 of the 20 generators serviced to date. But there was one generator failure this year because its batteries failed. "It’s a pity the hospital has to spend so much money on diesel in order to keep essential functions going when power is cut," Bloom said. The opposition party said generators only provided power for emergency operations, adding that continued power cuts made it difficult for patients to get treated for elective surgery, which often have to be cancelled due to power cuts. " Elective surgeries have to be cancelled with devastating effects for patients on long waiting lists. This strengthens the case for all public hospitals to be exempted from Eskom load shedding," he said.
