THE fraud case against former senior government official Margaret Ann Diedricks has been postponed to 23 September 2022 to Bloemfontein High Court. Today (Thursday) Diedricks 58, appeared at the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court and was released on R100 000 bail. Diedricks was arrested in Alberton on Wednesday by the Hawks serious corruption team based in Bloemfontein. The matter is in connection with the R255 million asbestos tender that the Free State government issued in 2014. Hawks spokesperson Captain Christopher Singo said it is alleged that during the period of 2014 and 2017, an irregular contract was awarded to a service provider for the eradication of asbestos roofs by the Human Settlement Department in Free State. Singo said the accused, who was the acting HOD of the Human Settlement Department in Gauteng, also authorised the same service provider irregularly in Gauteng. “She then fraudulently received an amount of more than R7m from the service provider,” said Singo. Singo said the matter was reported to the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation team for further investigation which culminated to the arrest of the suspect. “Twelve other accused, including five companies, have already been arrested regarding the asbestos case,” Singo said. The other twelve are expected to appear before the Bloemfontein High Court on September 23. Other prominent people in the R255m asbestos fraud case includes suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule. He recently accused the NPA of deliberately delaying the case to prevent him from participating in the highly contested party leadership race. Magashule and others will all appear in court on September 23. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
