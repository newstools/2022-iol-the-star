SIYABONGA SITHOLE National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) has defended itself against media attacks, which suggest that its leaders are corrupt, dishonest and involved in ANC factional battles, among other things.  The concerted effort is part of a media statement penned by the union's secretary-general Irvin Jim with the union saying it rejects suggestions that its leaders and the ANC were involved in the formation of a political party, called the SRWP, in 2013 which was established to contest the ANC during elections. "As a union Numsa has consistently championed radical economic transformation policies such as the nationalisation of all commanding heights and all our minerals and at the back of such minerals, we have consistently demanded that the state must intervene in the economy and champion a job-led industrial strategy.  “It is Micah Reddy who does not see such policies as constituting radical economic transformation," Numsa said in a statement. The trade union which boasts more than 350 000 members said it has never neglected its mandate to fight for the rights of its members and holding employers accountable –adding that it is through their fight and unwavering support of its members that it won a case against labour brokers in 2018. Numsa further accused Reddy and Ground Up as  being responsible for the negative outlook of the labour movement which in turn had worked to sow divisions within the labour union and some of its alliance partners. "The misuse of the media to side with particular factions and drive their politically opportunistic agenda with the labour movement (targeting Numsa) for capture by right-wing marauding gangs of no particular origin has unfortunately been picked up on in recent months by other media houses.  “We are therefore very disappointed that on March 1 Ground Up published the first of a series of misleading articles on 3Sixty Life, the insurance company owned by Numsa. These articles consistently inferred that the financial difficulties at the insurer are a consequence of corrupt behaviour of Numsa the general secretary," the union added in the statement.
