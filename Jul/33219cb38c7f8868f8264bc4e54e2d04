The first day of the ANC National Policy Conference at Nasrec was finished off without any scenes of insurrection as many expected, and today delegates get ready for day two, where various commissions are set to be mapped-out the whole day. Day one saw the ANC delegates do a self-retrospection, and assess all the merits and demerits of their policies and better approaches and proposals that will be of service to South Africa. The NPC conference will wrap up tomorrow with hopes that there will be solutions and plans to tackle some of the critical issues that were cited yesterday. While many had expected more action and explosive scenes because of factions, the first day was smooth sailing to a point of being called “boring” by many who attended. Several delegates took the stage and addressed some of the burning subjects affecting the country. Crucial points such as having a more youthful ANC and paying its workers were received with delight yesterday. Gender-Based violence was also highlighted as another pandemic by president Cyril Ramaphosa who mentioned how essential it was to tackle it. Several other subjects were brought to light with expectations that on Sunday everyone will have a clear understanding of what will happen next. Cosatu president, Zingiswa Losi also made a strong call for assertive people-centred leadership that will ensure that those deployed in government commit to a shared vision and goals. “We need to see a renewed and a rejuvenated ANC. This includes an ANC that pays its employees salaries in full and on time. Cosatu affirms its solidarity with the ANC employees who have gone through painful hardship over the past few years.” said Losi.
