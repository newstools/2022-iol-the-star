SIYABONGA SITHOLE A memorial service for the 16 victims of the Nomzamo tavern massacre will be held in Nomzamo on Thursday.  Speaking to members of the media, local leader and ward 30 Councillor Mohau Molefe said he and the provincial government were working to ensure that the memorial service took place as scheduled as some of the families would be leaving to arrange funeral services outside the province. He added that the community hall was not big enough to accommodate everyone. "The challenge is that the community hall here is not big enough. For a memorial service of this scale we will need help, and are in touch the with provincial government and other structures to help with the logistics. Another challenge is that those who are going to be buried here, their families want to come from outside the province, while those going away are being sorted out to travel and make funeral arrangements outside the province," Molefe said. Molefe added that most of the families were still rooted in their traditions, which should be respected. While members of the provincial social development services spent their day distributing food parcels and giving counselling to the families of the victims, the Ndlangisa family spent their time cleaning blood stains outside the Mdlalose tavern following the death of their son Njabulo Ndlangisa. However, the family refused to speak to the media, with the aunt of the victim, Nonkosi Ndlangisa, saying the family would like to be given space to do the ritual in peace.
