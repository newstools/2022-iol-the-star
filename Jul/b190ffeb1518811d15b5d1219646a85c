Johannesburg - A 25-year-old man who was kidnapped for ransom on July 13 was rescued unharmed by a police team established to crack kidnapping cases. SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Netshiunda said the team obtained yet another success when they arrested five suspects for the alleged kidnapping on Saturday. According to the police, the team were alerted about a man allegedly kidnapped on July 13, and instituted an investigation. “On the night of July 23, a suspect was arrested in Leandra, Gauteng, for allegedly demanding a ransom. Further investigations led the police to an address in Devon, Gauteng, where three suspects were arrested after they were found guarding the victim. The trio were immediately detained and the 25-year-old victim was rescued unharmed,” Netshiunda said. He added that further intelligence pointed the team to other premises in Leandra where another suspect was arrested. He was found in possession of a firearm with live ammunition, multiple cellphones as well as SIM cards. “The five suspects, aged between 35 and 50, will appear in court soon on charges of kidnapping, illegal possession of firearms and ammunition as well as extortion,” the spokesperson said.
