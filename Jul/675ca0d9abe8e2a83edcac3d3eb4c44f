SIYABONGA SITHOLE With the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) set to hold its 11th national congress from tomorrow (Monday), the union has come to the defence of its general secretary, Irvin Jim. The union has rubbished claims against its general secretary, Irvin Jim, who is accused by co-founder of the Institute for Economic Justice Neil Coleman of purging second deputy president Ruth Ntlokotse and other suspended members. Coleman further asserts that Jim had lied in an affidavit. Coleman said Jim was responsible for the recent suspension and purging of Ntlokotse after she had challenged him on the matter involving 3Sixty Life, adding that Jim was refusing to allow democratic processes within Numsa. However, Numsa has challenged Coleman for tweeting without facts, adding that his accusations against its general secretary were baseless. “It is unfortunate that the co-founder of the Institute of Economic Justice can commit the grave injustice of tweeting without facts. Your allegation is false and unfounded. Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim did not lie in his affidavit. “We must call out those who falsely claim to fight for the working class and democracy when they are attempting to bully the union into accepting the will of the minority. They want to force the congress to collapse because of a handful of people who want to get their way. Numsa says Coleman, who is the co-founder of the Institute for Economic Justice, needs to disclose to funders of the institute what are his interests in causing divisions within Numsa. “Neil Coleman must disclose to funders of the Institute of Economic Justice what his interests are in advancing the agenda of a faction within Numsa. He is working with those who seek to collapse the congress with false allegations," Numsa said.
