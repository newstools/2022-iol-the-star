The City of Johannesburg has managed to save a number of cars that were expected to be auctioned by the sheriff of the court this week. The cars were set to go under the hammer after the City had dragged its feet following through with a court order to pay the legal fees of a group of workers who had been dismissed. The Johannesburg Labour Court had issued a cost order after granting an interdict to the dismissal of the workers pending a bargaining council process. The sheriff of the court had already identified five cars that were attached to recover about R500 000 owed to two senior counsel. Mabine Seabe, a spokesperson for Johannesburg mayor Mpho Phalatse, said payments had been made to the lawyers. “The City’s Group Legal and Contracts Department has made payments to the attorneys for the applicants in line with the cost order,” Seabe said. Lawyers representing workers also confirmed that they had received the payment but that it had come after weeks of requests. The 130 workers were expected to take their fight to get their jobs back to the Johannesburg High Court. The city had dismissed the workers after it was discovered that their contracts had been illegally converted fixed-term contracts to permanent contracts.  The ANC in the City of Johannesburg had accused the DA-led administration of purging all employees linked to the ANC. But the city denied this. “Opposition parties will say anything to remain relevant even if it’s untrue. Questions about party affiliation do not form part of the city’s HR hiring processes,” Seabe said.
