Music powerhouse Kelly Khumalo has shared a message that she says she received from God last Sunday which revealed a lot of things about South Africa and the world. The star took to Instagram to share a video where she unpacked the message that she claims had consumed her for two hours when it was communicated to her. Khumalo revealed that “God is tired of false leaders”. “This is not just about South Africa but the whole world, false political leaders will go down. Pharmaceutical companies that are making money out of making God’s people sick will go down, the questionable justice systems will go down, false prophets, witch doctors and priests will go down, unfaithful husbands and wives will go down, and anything and everything ungodly will perish. May our God cover us through this drastic change. Those who must step down must do it now before they are wiped out.” The “Empini” hitmaker added that when she asked God why her, he said it does not matter who you are, if he wants to send someone a message he will do it. Speaking about the message, Khumalo explained that this message also involves the justice system and poverty. She spoke about the prices of food and petrol that are rocketing and making it difficult to buy anything in South Africa. “So in closing, it is really up to you. Whether you listen to me or you don’t. At least I have passed the message. Today everything will be fine when we sleep, but when we wake up the world will be upside down,” said Khumalo. “So I am telling you now if you need to pray, pray. If you need to prepare yourself, prepare yourself however way, but it all depends on God. And God is getting ready to put people in place. His people are not the people who are in there for themselves, for their self-gratification and greed. And that time has come to an end.”
