It is no secret that in the past few years gender-based violence (GBV) has become the centre of discourse, particularly with the shocking and heinous crimes committed against women and children every day in South Africa. Just when people were celebrating justice being served after Ntuthuko Shoba was sentenced to life in prison after orchestrating the murder of his girlfriend Tshegofatso Pule, more shocking news broke. It is believed that eight models and their crew went to Krugersdorp near an unused mine dump to shoot a music video when they were accosted by 10 armed men wearing blankets. The robbers then began taking the women in succession to the open veld where they allegedly gang-raped them. This happens just days away from welcoming women's month which honours women from all walks of life. Addressing scores of delegates at the ANC Policy Conference, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa detailed the need to focus on GBV. “What we now need to do at this conference. I would like us to focus a little bit more attention on the rising scourge of gender-based violence and ensure that we debated this matter and find solutions that possibly go beyond what we have initiated. With the wisdom that resides in this conference, it would be good, comrades, if we could come up with other solutions. Gender-Based Violence continues to rage in our country.” said Ramaphosa. He further added that during the health pandemic it was characterised as the second pandemic, but it continues. He revealed that what happened in North West is a manifestation of the spread of the scourge of gender-based violence.
