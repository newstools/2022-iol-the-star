SIYABONGA SITHOLE With crime statistics showing rising incidents of violent crimes and South Africans shocked by the recent deaths in taverns, there are growing calls for the police to step up their fight against crime. This past weekend, the DA launched a petition, calling for Police Minister Bheki Cele to step down. The petition, the party says, is due to the high number of violent murders and rape statistics in the country.  It comes in the wake of a spate of shootings in taverns across the country, following the Nomzamo shooting that claimed 16 lives in the early hours of Sunday, July 10 2022; the Katlehong shooting which claimed two lives and the Sweetwaters tavern shooting in Pietermaritzburg which claimed four lives. DA police spokesperson Andrew Whitfield says the ANC and the minister must face up to the SAPS’s failure to prevent crime. Whitfield says the DA will not allow the ANC to feign helplessness as it sidesteps its national government obligation to keep South Africans safe. "Today, the ANC premier of Gauteng appealed to Gauteng citizens to do the work of the SAPS by identifying criminals in communities. Then, the ANC itself, in a national statement, called on all South Africans to find and prosecute criminals. These calls are dangerously close to fanning the flames of vigilantism and are convenient defections of the obligations to prevent and investigate crime by the SAPS," Whitfield says. The DA has called on South Africans not to tolerate the failings of the political leadership. It has launched a petition calling on the minister to resign. "It is time for the SAPS to be led by a serious and skilled minister who can make serious changes needed to get the SAPS working," he said.
