SIYABONGA SITHOLE Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola has confirmed that President Cyril Ramaphosa did not report a case of theft at Phala Phala farm to the police in 2020. In an affidavit dated July 12, Masemola says the robbery which happened on February 10, 2020 was not directly reported to the police but the president reported this security breach and robbery to head of protection services Major-General Wally Rhoode. “I hereby confirm that on February 10, 2020, the President of the Republic of South Africa made a report of a security breach at his farm, Phala Phala to the head of presidential protection services of the South African Police Services, Major General Wally Rhoode. I further confirm the alleged theft/robbery was reported on March 2, 2020 by the president of the republic of South Africa to Major-General Rhoode as per paragraph 18 of the said affidavit,” Masemola testifies. Masemola added that there was no case opened by the president following the robbery and that following a complaint laid by former head of state security, Arthur Fraser at Rosebank in June this year, the case had since been transferred to Bela Bela police. “Based on the enquiries made with the provincial commissioner of Limpopo and station commander of SAPS Bela Bela, I hereby confirm that no case was opened/registered following the alleged theft at the president’s property at Phala Phala farm. The complaint by Mr Arthur Fraser which was registered as Rosebank CAS2/6/2022 was transferred to Bela Bela SAPS and is currently registered as Bela-Bela CAS93/06/2022,” Masemola says in his affidavit.
