Durban - Popular nightclub in Sandton, Gauteng, Taboo, announced that it would be closing its doors for business permanently. The Taboo group said that the Onyx, another popular nightlife spot, would remain open. Taboo Sandton was arguably one of South Africa’s most vibrant nightclubs, and according to a statement by the company, late owner Chris Coutroulis had a unique vision for the club prior to its opening.
