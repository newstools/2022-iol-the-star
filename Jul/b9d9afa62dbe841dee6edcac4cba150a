SIYABONGA SITHOLE One person who was wounded during the shooting at Nomzamo’s KwaMdlalose tavern on Sunday has died in hospital.  Fifteen people were killed when gunmen opened fire on tavern patrons in the early hours of Sunday. The news of wounded patient’s death was confirmed by Community Safety MEC Faith Mazibuko, who addressed a family bereavement ceremony at the Nomzamo Community Hall yesterday.  The event was attended by members of faith-based organisations, councillor Mohau Molefe as well as officials from social services gathered at the Nomzamo Community Hall to offer their support to families of the victims of the mass shooting at the tavern on Sunday.  The visit follows hot on the heels of a community engagement visit by Police Minister Bheki Cele and his commissioners on Monday which resulted in the dispatching of law enforcement agencies to patrol the streets of the affected township. Mazibuko said as the provincial government they were saddened by the news that another victim had passed on, adding that the department and all stakeholders were working on a series of interventions to help families bury their loved ones with dignity. “We are in the process of helping families and have asked the councillor to be in contact and follow all the processes needed to bring the bodies of the loved ones home according to cultural customs.  “We have brought a range of assistance from Social Development and other structures. We also understand families are challenged and other family members are unemployed. We have also asked our social workers to assist with counselling and speak to you about other interventions,” she said. Mazibuko said police were working around the clock to investigate the shooting. Molefe urged religious groups and leaders to also pray for those in hospital. “Let us collaborate across the board to ensure that everyone is supported, including those who have died and those recovering,” Molefe said.
