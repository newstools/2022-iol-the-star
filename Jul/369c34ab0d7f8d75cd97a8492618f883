SIYABONGA SITHOLE The African Transformation Movement (ATM) has called for the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and the special task force to be deployed across areas dominated by illegal miners. The call by the ATM comes after the horrific rape of eight young women by a group of zama zamas in Krugersdorp on Friday. ATM leader Vuyo Zungula added his call on the gruesome rape saying it was a despicable act. “SANDF and SAPS special task force teams must conduct massive raids in identified hot spot areas, remove such assault weapons and arrest the criminals. “The gang rape of eight young women at the hands of heavily armed and trained ex-soldiers from neighbouring countries who are illegal miners is despicable. Government must protect innocent citizens from such brutality by enforcing our laws. We can’t allow people live in such fear,” he said. The party added that no mercy must be shown to those responsible for acts of rape and violence against women, adding that areas with abandoned mines should be prioritised as part of crime prevention. “No mercy should be shown to these barbaric individuals. They must be made an example of what happens to those who have lost their humanity. Communities with abandoned mines in areas such as Klerksdorp and Carltonville, that are terrorised by illegal miners must receive top priority.  SANDF and special task forces must be deployed to those communities where illegal miners seek refuge underground after committing such heinous crimes. We need a deliberate process to remove illegal weapons, in particular the high calibre weapons like Uzzis and AK47s and other weapons that are in clear contravention of the Dangerous Weapons Act 15 of 2013 including other domestic laws,“ the party said. The party also said health and social services should help the victims with access to healthcare and counselling services following this ordeal.
