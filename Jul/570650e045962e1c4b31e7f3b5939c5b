SIYABONGA SITHOLE Johannesburg - The Democratic Alliance is calling for a debate on the theft and vandalism of public infrastructure, with a debate set for September 1. According to the party, theft and vandalism of government infrastructure costs government over R7 billion a year and results in R187 billion economic losses to the country. The DA spokesperson on trade, industry and competition, Mat Cuthbert said the country needs a whole-society approach to protect state infrastructure. He said this can be done through neighbourhood patrols, community watches and community policing forums (CPF). These and other interventions aimed at curbing infrastructure theft and vandalism will firm part of the party's debate on the impact of vandalism. Cuthbert said the DA will during the upcoming debate call for national government to join local government's efforts to address and eradicate the rampant vandalism and destruction of public infrastructure which continues unabated. Some of the proposed interventions that the DA is advocating for include: eradication of the backlog scrap dealer licenses, the standardisation of recording of all scrap metal sales, empowerment of the non-ferrous metal crime combating committee through legislation and budget, proper implementation of the Second-hand Goods Act of 2009, as well as close cooperation between law enforcement and metal recyclers to track illegal traders of metals. Cuthbert said the problem of infrastructure vandalism cannot be solved if there is no collaboration between different government structures. "Local government cannot take this problem on their own. National and Provincial government, civil society and law enforcement must all work together to address the problem and save the economy. South Africa will continue to bleed jobs until infrastructure damage and theft have been halted, " Cuthbert said in a statement.
