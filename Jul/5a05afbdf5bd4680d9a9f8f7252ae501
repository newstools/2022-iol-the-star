SIYABONGA SITHOLE The DA’s spokesperson for health, Jack Bloom said more than 785 operations were cancelled at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Hospital last year. Bloom said the growing number of surgeries at the embattled hospital were confirmed to him by Gauteng health MEC Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi, in a written response to his question in the Gauteng Legislature. Bloom said the paediatric department was the worst affected with 610 cancelled operations. The endothoracic department saw 80 cancellations with 40 cancellations in the gastrointestinal unit, followed by 25 cancellations at the breast clinic, 20 neurosurgeries and 20 cancellations of ear, nose and throat surgeries. Bloom added the longest waiting list was for orthopaedic surgeries, with 833 patients on the waiting list for up to two years. He said the paediatric surgery unit had 453 children on its waiting list, who have been forced to wait between six months to two years. “There are 200 cataract patients waiting between six to eight months for surgery. A total of 137 neurosurgery patients have to wait six months, and 109 urology patients are expected to wait between four to six months for surgery.  “I think these figures underestimate the true situation, as it leaves out long sitting periods for many patients to be diagnosed by a specialist before they are placed on the waiting list for surgery,” Bloom pointed out. Some of the major contributing factors for the cancellations and waiting times are attributed to the shortage of ICU beds, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic and the recent fires at the hospital. "It is particularly upsetting that many children suffer from surgery delays. This highlights the need to fully reopen the hospital as a matter of urgency,” Bloom said.
