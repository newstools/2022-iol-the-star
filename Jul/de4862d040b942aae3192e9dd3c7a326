In efforts to tackle the issues surrounding sustainability and focusing on the RE initiative, which consists of the three key pillars “rethink, reduce and repurpose”, Nestlé has introduced Starbucks At Home by Nespresso capsules made using 80% recycled aluminium. With aluminium known as being infinitely recyclable, the popular coffee house company said the benefits of using recycled aluminium and the amount of energy saved in its production is well suited to the circular economy. The recycled aluminium comes from a variety of sources including post-consumer scrap as well as scrap recovered during the production processes. Using 80% recycled aluminium not only is better for the environment, but aluminium is also one of the best materials to keep freshness and protect the aromas of the coffee.  It provides an exceptional barrier to oxygen, light and humidity and is therefore an excellent choice to protect volatile aromas and freshness for a long time. Business executive officer for Beverages at Nestlé East and Southern Africa Region, Nicole Roos, explained: “With every material we use to produce the capsules, we are committed to ensuring that none of our packagings ends up in landfill or as litter and aim to minimise the impact of our packaging on the environment.  “This includes advocating for adequate recycling infrastructure for coffee capsules regardless of the material used. In addition, aluminium can be re-melted and reused infinitely, giving it a second life.”  Roos said they motivate their customers to recycle their aluminium capsules. “By using 80% recycled aluminium, we demonstrate the recyclability of aluminium and want to encourage our consumers to recycle their aluminium capsules. When we recycle the Starbucks At Home by Nespresso coffee capsules you also help decrease the carbon footprint of your cup of coffee. This is a key aspect of the Nestlé ESAR RE initiative,” said Roos.
