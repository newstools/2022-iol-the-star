SIYABONGA SITHOLE The City of Johannesburg’s department of community development says it has appointed the Johannesburg Development Agency (JDA) to finalise the building of a R43 million swimming pool complex in Ivory Park, Tembisa, on the East Rand. The swimming pool complex, which has been mired in budgetary delays, is touted as a multifunctional development set to unearth Olympic champions through training of future Olympians. The announcement of the finalisation of this project comes just when the city began its new financial year at the beginning of July and forms part of the city’s continued infrastructural development across the city. Located  in Ward 111 on Freddy Drive, Ivory Park, the complex will boast an Olympic-style swimming pool and splash pool with a grandstand for spectators. It will also make use of the latest advances in technology such as solar panels for water heating, water tanks for water harvesting, greywater recycling as well as waterless toilets among the many other innovations. MMC for community development Ronald Harris says the project will play an important role in uniting communities and improving quality of life among the many young people and aspiring athletes in the city. “Community development is a key custodian of social cohesion and plays a critical role in uniting communities as well as contributing to a quality of life. The pool complex will offer a range of uses and choices to people who live, play, learn, share, socialise and visit it,” Harris said. According to JDA spokesperson Elias Nkabinde, construction of the R43m swimming pool complex is nearing full completion after a series of budgetary delays. “Construction started in September 2019 but due to budgetary constraints the project was implemented over three financial years. “The project has reached practical completion and is due to be handed over to the Community Development Department, following the finalisation of snags", Nkabinde told The Star.
