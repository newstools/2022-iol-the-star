Six officials are behind bars after the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), National Traffic Anti-Corruption Unit (NTACU) and the Hawks exposed an alleged multimillion-rand vehicle licensing fraud ring in Mpumalanga. Five provincial administrators from the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison and an Mbombela municipal clerk are alleged to have fraudulently redetermined the classification of hundreds of vehicles to avoid payment of licensing fees and penalties. RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said extensive investigations by the RTMC's NTACU indicate that the province has lost close to R60 million in revenue as a result of the alleged unlawful activities of the suspects. Zwane said they are expected to be charged with 603 counts of fraud, corruption and money laundering when they appear in the Mbombela Specialised Commercial Crimes Court later on Monday. The alleged crimes were committed between 2018 and 2019 and it is believed that they involved collusion with many other officials from registering authorities in the province. “The RTMC reiterates its commitment in dealing with fraud and corruption and urges members of the public to report all suspicions of malfeasances, bribery, fraud and corruption,” Zwane said. Hawks Mpumalanga spokesperson Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi said the suspects will appear in court today. “We have arrested six traffic officers for issuing driving licences fraudulently. The accused are at 33 Van Rensburg office. We are charging and taking them to court today,” said Sekgotodi. NPA Mpumalanga spokesperson Monica Nyuswa said the suspects were granted bail. “They appeared and granted bail of R15 000 and each and the matter was postponed to 28 September for further investigations,” said Nyuswa. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
