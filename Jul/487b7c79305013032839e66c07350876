It seems like catching a break on social media is something celebrities hardly see, especially with each day they are either trolled or given despicable names. When a video of DJ Zinhle and AKA dancing and celebrating the birthday of their 7-year daughter Kairo Forbes landed on social media, it caused a stir that went on for days. Seeing the popular duo in one place having a jolly time in the name of their daughter, had Zinhle receive massive trolls with many insinuating she might still have a “thing” for AKA. With Twitter popular as a hub of toxicity, among other social media platforms, DJ Zinhle caught the wind of criticism and responded in a string of posts as other celebrities defended her. “Sad thing about half of the people trolling me here is that they’ll one day work for me and I won’t even know I’ve hired devils. “It’s not about what’s wrong or right, it’s about getting a reaction. No matter what it takes, no matter who it hurts. You’ll think they’ll go easy where there’s kids involved but no, they are drowning themselves,” said Zinhle Media personality Anele Mdoda reacted to the trolls, saying, “The same people who are to opine Zinhle and AKA and how they choose to raise their daughter in an who preach mental health and throw around buzz words like heal.” Popular actor Sello kaNcube shared his sentiment, saying he respects DJ Zinhle. “South Africans are really sad, @Zinhle is doing what many of us wished and longed for most of our lives. For our babymamas to be mature enough and put aside our differences as parents, and allow us access to our children. Single, women should learn from you. You have my respect.” Renowned Journalist Chriselda Lewis lauded Zinhle for being a great parent. “I am so sorry Zinhle that you have to deal with this. Some people are just vile. You don’t deserve this. From what I see you are a fantastic mother. Don’t be deterred or disrupted. Continue to be you,” said Lewis.
