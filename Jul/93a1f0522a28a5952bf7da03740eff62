Johannesburg - The Democratic Alliance (DA) said it was immensely proud that Banyana Banyana was crowned the 2022 Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) champions. Banyana Banyana were crowned the African Queens for the first time after beating hosts Morocco 2-1 in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (Wafcon) final at Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium on Saturday night. The DA said South Africa’s historic victory was not only a feather in the cap of the team but also their coach Desiree Ellis, who won her third consecutive Confederation of African Football (CAF) Women's Coach of the Year award. “This victory shows the talent and determination of South African women and South African women in leadership. Like many other teams, Banyana Banyana had to overcome several challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only did the team flourish in the face of adversity, they showed South Africa the true meaning of nation-building and social cohesion,” the DA’s Tsepo Mhlongo said. The party further urged the South African Football Association (SAFA) to fulfil its promise of R400 000 bonuses to each member of the winning squad without any of the delays that have marred previous similar promises. “Safa's bonus of R10 million to the team shows that women's sports are worth investing in, and we once again urge the Department of Sport Arts and Culture to follow suit. By developing sports at grassroots levels across all South African communities, we can give our children the hope of brighter futures,” Mhlongo said. The Star
