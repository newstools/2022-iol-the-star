After the success of the first-ever Rand Show Spring Edition in 2021, the organisers of this entertainment event are delighted to be hosting another rendition from September 29 to October 2 at Fourways Mall. The Spring Edition promises a fun-filled day of activities that will allow families and friends to ditch staying at home and get outside for a great day out. With new management at its helm, Rand Show 2022 is a fresh take on an old South African favourite. Earlier this year “The Star” reported about the show when it returned to Nasrec where people immersed themselves in the memorable experience. Sharing on their Facebook page, the Rand Show team wrote: “Join us for four amazing, fun-filled days that will excite every member of the family. We will be at Fourways Mall from the 29th September till the 2nd October from 9am-7pm daily. From food to fun, we have something for everyone.” On the first rendition of the show, chief executive of the Rand Show, Adele Hartdegen shared the activities festival-goers could look forward to. “Bring a blanket, have a joyful family day out while soaking up the South African sun, listening to original South African music and sampling the delicious food and drink from our local vendors. Festival-goers will also have access into the Rand Show itself at no extra cost," said Hartdegen. Among some of the biggest drawcards this year are an exclusive music festival featuring some of South Africa’s best-known artists; a reality cooking competition, adventurous all-day kids’ activities and activations, and of course, exhilarating carnival rides. For the Spring Show, there will be baking and face painting, art and crafts for kids, train rides, biking, pedal carts, magic shows, advanced driving, traditional dancers, bars and lounges, quad biking, ballet recitals, a car show and live wrestling. There is no cost for entry. Simply arrive and enjoy a host of entertainment, shopping, food and festivities.
