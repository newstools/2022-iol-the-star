SIYABONGA SITHOLE The City of Johannesburg says it has remodelled the Johannesburg Tourism Company as a standalone entity separate from the directorate of the Department of Economic Development.  This move comes as the city has entered the financial year of 2022/23 with the MMC for economic development, Nkululeko Mbundu, saying the company will now operate as a destination management organisation in support of the city’s tourism sector, which was badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on travel and tourism. This move is seen as a catalyst for change and the revival of the industry in post-pandemic South Africa, which has seen the country return to full-scale economic activity after almost two years of stagnation. According to Mbundu, the multi-party government is excited over this move as it should usher in a much-needed revival of the sector. “We are thrilled that the entity’s establishment has finally come to pass. After months of strenuous behind-the-scenes work, which started with the appointment of a nimble board of directors at the beginning of 2022, the team in the newly found directorate has commenced with council proceedings. It has also ensured adherence to all relevant legal, governance and core business requirements,” Mbundu said. The MMC said this new venture brought with it positive developments for the City of Johannesburg as well as for the tourism company as they look set to drive the economic growth that comes with a fully functional tourism sector. “The Covid-19 pandemic impacted heavily on the City of Johannesburg. Our communities and economy  suffered human and economic blows. However, we want to seize the opportunities to rebuild and refocus our economy, ensuring it is more competitive and adapted to the changes of the pandemic and technology have brought to the world,” Mbundu added.
