Two men are expected to appear at the Orlando Magistrate’s Court on Thursday, facing charges of trespassing and contempt of court. The suspects were arrested this morning (Wednesday) at a hijacked property in Diepkloof, Zone 4, Soweto. They are being detained at Diepkloof police station. The matter was reported to the city’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service (GFIS) department for investigation in June. GFIS spokesperson Lucky Sindane said that during the investigation it was established that the property owner was being denied access to the property by the occupants. Sindane said the owner had previously approached the high court, where an eviction order was granted and executed on May 17. However, the suspects forcefully moved back into the property on the same day. He said a special operation was conducted by GFIS working with the SAPS Property Hijacking Investigation Task Team and the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD). “The property has been secured and handed over to the owner. The city is committed to ensuring that it stops the rot in Joburg and make it a prosperous and inclusive place for our people to live, work and play,” Sindane said. He said the city would also like to encourage people to report any fraud and corruption activities through the 24-hour tip-off hotline 0800 002 587 or email problempropertyhotline@joburg.org.za or whistle@joburg.org.za or visit the offices of GFIS situated at 48 Ameshoff Street, Braamfontein. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
