Cope is calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa and his ministers to release and publish the list of double agents. On Monday, the party said as long as the democratic government was still hiding the list of double agents who worked with the apartheid government, instability and lawlessness in the country would continue. Cope national spokesperson Dennis Bloem said former officials of the apartheid government’s National Intelligence Agency and former cabinet ministers were in possession of a list of all those who had been double agents during the struggle against apartheid and sold out their comrades. “We believe it is extremely important for government to release such a list,” Bloem said. He added that, for years, former president Jacob Zuma threatened to release a list of all the sell-outs. Bloem said everyone had been waiting for Zuma to make the list public. “The country is facing unprecedented lawlessness, shootings and killings of innocent people. The amount of firearms and ammunition is scary and raises a lot of questions. For example, where do these firearms come from?” said Bloem. He further said: “It is only in South Africa where double agents, traitors, are protected by the government, people who are still causing untold damage to the country and the future of generations to come”. Bloem said Cope cannot understand what was preventing the democratic government from releasing and publishing the names of all these double agents. “We call upon Ramaphosa and his security ministers and the former apartheid security officials to release and publish the list of names of these double agents. It will be in the best interest of the country to do so,” Bloem said. However, the Presidency told “The Star” that the president was not aware of this alleged list. “The president is not aware of such a call and we do not know what is Cope’s motive for such a call,” said Ramaphosa’s spokesperson Vincent Magwenya. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
