A video has gone viral on social media, showing an old man fighting about five thugs who clearly intended to rob or hijack a vehicle carrying what looked like his family. The incident happened at Klerksdorp CBD in North West province. Residents there told The Star that crime has increased. In the video captured by a local woman, five thugs approach a SUV with occupants inside. The old man, carrying only what looked like a knife, is seen determined to fight off the thugs. It is evident that he is not planning for his family to fall victim to crime. The thugs on more than one occasion are seen trying to intimidate the old man but he is focused. One thug tries to open the driver’s door but the old man manages to scare him off. After a few minutes, the old man targets one thug, and though losing his balance, manages to get up and make a noise. This brings more attention to what is going on since many people stop and watch. The thugs, some with their arms folded, are then seen calmly walking away from the scene as if nothing happens. Onlookers are seen just watching and not attempting to assist the man and his family, a move which some social media users criticised. “Klerksdorp has become a dangerous place to live in. Why are people watching and not helping?” wrote Boitumelo Semelo. A number of social media users applauded the old man for being brave and not backing down. Last month a journalist fell victim of crime, her cellphone was stolen right outside court. North West Provincial SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said they wanted to first confirm the incident with the station before commenting. ntombi.nkosi@inl.co.za
