The African People’s Convention (APC) has said Eskom should supply free electricity to all South Africans and wipe away all debt owed by poor townships. The party’s president, Themba Godi, said Eskom had a social mandate to carry out and cannot regard itself as a private company. Godi demanded that Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan and the entire management of Eskom step down. “Eskom continues to deteriorate under their watch. We are clear that the root of the problem lies in the policy trajectory, the hollowing of Eskom for privatisation,” Godi said. Godi said the anger of South Africans should be directed to those in leadership, especially those in the ruling party. “Azania is exporting an ever increasing amount (of coal) to Europe which they use to generate electricity for their people. It has been confirmed in the British parliament that during the last G7 summit in Germany, Ramaphosa confirmed that his government is handing over power generation and Eskom to vultures of international capital,” Godi said. Godi said independent power producers (IPP) were also part of Eskom’s privatisation. He said he was shocked that European countries were putting pressure on South Africa to stop generating power from coal while they were developing their industries using coal. “We are clear that this fight is not a war of quick decisions but one of attrition. We have prepared ourselves for the long haul and this is not the last time you see and hear from us,” Godi said. The APC is on a national campaign to push for the resignation of the Eskom management and Gordhan. They are also demanding an end to load shedding and an investigation into corruption and sabotage at Eskom.
