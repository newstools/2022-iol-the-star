Pretoria – Alex FM in Gauteng has announced that its music manager, 32-year-old Joshua Mbatha, affectionately known as DJ Josh, has died after being shot during a robbery. “It's with great pain to inform you of the sad news of the passing on of our staff member Joshua Mbatha. DJ Josh, as he was affectionately known, was the music manager at Alex FM,” said Alex FM chairperson Isaac Mangena. “He was on his way with two of his colleagues, Sammy Ramodike and Matome Mookanedi, when they were stopped by about three gunmen. They (assailants) took their phones and shoes before shooting Joshua in the chest.” Mangena said Mbatha succumbed to his injuries at Masakhane Clinic at around 9pm last night. “We are with his father and other family members now at the clinic. The station manager is also with his team, comforting each other. Let's keep the family and Josh's colleagues in our prayers. May his soul rest in peace,” said Mangena. “A promising career gone too soon.” Mangena said, the funeral details and memorial service would be announced in due course after consultations with the family.
