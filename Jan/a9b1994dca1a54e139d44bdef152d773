DURBAN - A widow of a taxi boss from Cato Ridge, KwaZulu-Natal, and her alleged accomplices will know their fate on Tuesday as the Camperdown Magistrate’s Court is expected to hand down a bail decision in an insurance-linked murder case. The widow, Jane Ziningi Nzama, 49, her “boyfriend”, a pastor and traditional healer in Inchanga, Mthokozisi Majozi, 49, and her relative Simphiwe Silangwe, 29, recently applied for bail at Camperdown Magistrate’s Court in the alleged murder of 20-year-old Asanda Nzama. The matter was postponed to on Tuesday a for bail decision. The State is opposed to the accused being granted bail. All three accused were remanded in custody. It is alleged that Nzama plotted with Majozi and Silangwe to have her son Asanda killed in order to claim from insurance. Nzama is being kept at the Westville Prison. In December, Nzama pleaded guilty to the murder of her son. Police then arrested her “boyfriend” Majozi, allegedly the mastermind behind the killing of Asanda. According to the police, Asanda was found inside a house in the Esikhelekehleni area in Inchanga with gunshot wounds to the head and body and was declared dead at the scene. Nzama is the widow of the late taxi boss Mzophethwe Nzama, who was gunned down last year. She was arrested last month alongside Silangwe, but could not appear in court as she was in hospital after alleged attempts to commit suicide allegedly to evade jail. Sources close to the matter told the Daily News that Nzama was arrested and put into a cell. However, when the officers checked on her, she was apparently foaming at the mouth and had to be rushed to hospital for medical assistance. “There are suspicions that she might have drunk pills or something prior to the arrest to kill herself,” a source said. Provincial police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was being investigated by Inchanga SAPS. Gwala previously confirmed that Nzama was under police guard in hospital. Daily News
