Johannesburg - St Mary’s School star matric performer Luthando Simelane says that apart from working hard in her final year of high school last year, she took some down time during a stressful year by participating in school activities, such as cinematography. Simelane obtained six distinctions. “I also spent my free time reading and spending quality time with friends and family,” she said. Simelane said her time would include following current affairs, which she is passionate about. “I would like to study chemical engineering as I have a keen interest in chemistry and would like to explore that at a higher level. My preferred institution is the University of Cape Town,” she said. She said that this year's matriculants simply need to take things a day at a time and, although it is an academically challenging year, they will get through it. She said some of her proudest moments during her high school years were attaining full colours in Grade 11 and an award for practical biology (life science) skills. “I was most proud of these achievements because I felt as though they highlighted the effort I put into my academics. There are many things I’ll miss about high school. However, I will mostly miss seeing my friends every day and making jokes in and outside of the classroom,” she said. She said high school taught her a lot. In Grade 8 she described herself as timid and as a person who kept to herself. “Now I am more outgoing and confident within myself and able to perform well in other spheres outside of the classroom,” she said. She said she was anxious about results day but excited to see the results of her hard work and dedication. She expects to do well in most of her subjects, which include English (home language), geography, isiZulu (first additional language), life orientation, life science, mathematics and physical science.
