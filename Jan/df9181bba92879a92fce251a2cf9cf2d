Johahannesburg - While other matriculants would say that their final year of schooling was the most difficult, an Edenvale learner said high school became easier as he progressed through the grades. Kishan Harilal, from Edenvale High School achieved six disctinctions in Afrikaans (first additional language), maths, life orientation, accounting, life sciences and physical sciences. He told The Star his matric year wasn’t as difficult as he had expected; however there were some challenges here and there. “Most people say that matric is the most challenging year for me. I found that as I progressed further into high school, it became easier. The workload in matric was more but I think I coped nicely,” Kishan said. The top achiever said his biggest difficulty was the time constraints, the late start to the 2021 academic year and the lockdown implemented during the year just before the preliminary examinations because of Covid-18 waves. Kishan said one of his fond memories of his 2021 year was surprisingly during the prelim exams as his classmates and friends were able to study and work with each other to pass. He added that he was able to serve his school as a prefect. However, he spent most of his free time studying and doing extra lessons. The matriculant said he had aspirations to attend the University of Cape Town and obtain a degree in medicine. “I’ve always found myself wanting to learn more about the world. I believe that through medicine, I will be able to learn more about science, biology and living things. I also look forward to learning about research,” he said. When imparting advice for the Class of 2022, Kishan said that time moves very quickly in matric, but he urged the new matrics to take it slowly, take a step back and take the year as it comes. “Don’t be too stressed about it, especially because other people say it’s very hard and challenging. They should calm down, take a breath and think about it and they will do well,” he said. The Star
