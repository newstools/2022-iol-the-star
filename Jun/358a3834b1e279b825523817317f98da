Johannesburg - The Collen Mashawana Foundation, with the Old Mutual Foundation, will be handing over house keys to two families who were affected by the recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal on July 1 in Pietermaritzburg. From April 11 to 13, KwaZulu-Natal experienced heavy and devastating rainfall, which resulted in severe flooding in the province, leaving over 40 000 people displaced, more than 448 people dead, and over 12 000 houses destroyed. The foundation said one recipient of a brand new home is a 61-year-old grandmother, Bonakele Madlela, who lives with 22 family members in Caluza, and their mud house was reduced to rubble by the floods. The Madlela family found themselves scattered and had to find refuge from neighbours and relatives in the area. Another recipient is Alphosina Nini Dlamini, a 77-year-old partially blind grandmother, who looks after her two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, who lost their fathers in 2005. The family lived in a dilapidated mud house that was severely damaged by the heavy rains. On May 14, the Collen Mashawana Foundation’s representatives, led by the foundation’s founder Collen Mashawana and  Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu, visited the two families and committed to rebuilding the families’ homes. “We are proud of the collaboration between private and public sectors in aid of our fellow South Africans in need, and time and time again, we have shown that as a country, we can come together and extend a helping hand where needed,” said Mashawana. “We look forward to handing over the keys to the two families who are not only in need of homes but are deserving. It is also encouraging to see many partners coming on board to help us achieve our vision, and we hope for more collaborations in our efforts.” The Star
