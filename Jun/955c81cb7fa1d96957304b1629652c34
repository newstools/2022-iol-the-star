EFF leader Julius Malema has described the announcement of the arrest of the Gupta brothers as government spin fashioned to protect president Cyril Ramaphosa from the public scandal concerning the robbery at his Limpopo farm. Malema questioned the announcement of the arrest of Rajesh and Atul Gupta, He accused the South African government of concocting the story of the arrest and throwing it to the public as a diversion. "There is a possibility that this story might be used as a diversion. I am told the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) does not know this and therefore I am not going to entertain a diversion and a spin. The state went and wrote its own letter and sent it to the DG in the presidency and took their own bullet and put it there.  When South Africa refused to buy that story of intimidation of the DG as diversion then the Guptas were arrested," Malema said. The Department of Justice on Monday night confirmed that two of the Gupta brothers have been arrested in Dubai. The Gupta brothers and their wives fled South Africa amid investigations into their alleged looting of billions of rands from state-owned enterprises. The NPA applied to the international criminal police organisation to assist with the execution of arrest warrants.
