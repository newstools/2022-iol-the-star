A circular sent out by the Eastern Cape Department of Education has indicated that learners under the age of 12 have been vaccinated at schools without parents and guardians’ consent, contrary to protocol. The circular, signed by acting director Pumla Gxuluwe, emphasised the importance of ensuring that consent forms sent to provincial education departments recently were passed on to parents and guardians. Gxuluwe pointed out that the consent forms were circulated to provinces by Dr Granville Whittle, a deputy director-general in the national office. She said the basic education authorities picked up a trend of flouting vaccination protocols at schools following the publishing of standard operating procedures document. “This came with major implications as schools did not interpret it the same way,” said Gxuluwe in the circular. “Even service providers serving schools saw this as an opportunity to vaccinate learners without following the protocols around the issue of vaccination of learners, which have their own considerations that need to be adhered to.” Gxuluwe said the department sought to ensure adherence across the schools to the vaccination protocol. “To ensure this adherence, Acting DDG Dr Whittle has sent a standard Covid-19 consent form to all Heads of Department in all nine provinces,” she said. “This consent form is binding as the Department of Education will not be held responsible for any mishaps. “This is of utmost importance as only learners from 12 years and above should be vaccinated without a consent form signed by parents. It also insists on parents to accompany (them).” The forms Whittle sent out stated that the “Department of Basic Education, in partnership with the Department of Health, have agreed to provide in-school vaccinations against the Covid-19 for learners who are 12 years”. Consent had to be granted for pupils under 12. @BonganiNkosi87
