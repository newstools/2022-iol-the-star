The three brothers, who tragically succumbed after drinking “energy drinks” allegedly given by their father, will be laid to rest on Saturday Three brothers from Ratanda Primary School and Khanya Lesedi Secondary School in Heidelberg, Lehlogonolo Khoabane (16), Katleho Khoabane (13) and Tebogo Ngcongwane (6) succumbed after drinking drug-laced energy drinks allegedly given by their father, last Thursday. The family spokesperson Johannes Khoabane told The Star a memorial service for the deceased children will take place this evening at the Ratanda Multipurpose Hall. He further confirmed that the siblings will be laid to rest on Saturday. The boy’s father is facing charges of murder and attempted murder after he allegedly gave four of his five children and the family dog energy drinks laced with a specific drug after the boys’ mother left for work. Two of the boys tragically died shortly at school after complaining of stomach pains and the other died while being rushed to the hospital. The fourth child was critical at the hospital and the fifth child did not consume the concoction. Khoabane confirmed that the fourth child was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday and he said the family was happy that had returned home. He added that the funeral arrangements are going well. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed with The Star on Tuesday afternoon that the father was still in hospital under police guard. “The docket was taken to Heidelberg Magistrate Court on Monday the 30th of May for the suspect to appear in his absentia. It was remanded to 6 June,” Masondo said. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi, who visited the schools and family on Friday morning, said he was hurt to lose three children at the same time.
