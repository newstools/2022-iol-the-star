Johannesburg - A non-profit organisation aims to break the Guinness World Record for the world’s largest mosaic created from food tins, this Mandela Day. On July 18, Ladles of Love will attempt to create the world’s largest mosaic made out of food cans. Mandela Day is not meant as a public holiday, but as a day to honour the legacy of Nelson Mandela and his values, through volunteering and community service. The attempt will be taking place in Cape Town and Johannesburg simultaneously, with a gigantic Madiba face being created at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) and a massive South African flag being created in Sandton’s Nelson Mandela Square. The event will be held in the two cities on Sunday, July 17 and Monday, July 18 to provide multiple ways for the public to volunteer their 67 minutes for Mandela Day. Ladles of Love said every can of food collected for the mosaic would be donated to communities in need. The NPO is calling on the public to be part of this initiative. Coronation Fund Managers and other sponsors such as Rhodes Quality, the CTICC and Nelson Mandela Square were supporting the initiative, said Ladles of Love. People who would like to be part of this world record attempt can donate 67 minutes of their time at one of the venues for a fee of R150, which will go towards buying bulk nutritious food. Alternatively, people can sponsor five food cans for R100. “This is not Ladles of Love’s first attempt at a world record. The world record for the ‘longest line of food cans’ was smashed by more than double at the V&A Waterfront on August 29, 2021 with a 6.7km line of 94 560 food cans. The previous year the world record for the ‘most sandwiches made in one hour’ was broken by a mind-boggling 304 000 home-made sandwiches as compared to the previous record of 115 000,” Ladles of Love said. The NPO said all food donated was distributed to more than 200 soup kitchens that collectively feed 30 000 people a day. The Star
