Popular businesswoman Shauwn Mkhize received the nod of appreciation after contributing to those harshly affected by floods. Mkhize demonstrated her humanitarian helping hand by building and donating homes to affected families in Wyebank, KZN. Touching down to the flood-wrecked community, the Royal AM Boss spoke candidly about the magnitude of giving back to those in need revealing that she was once without a home after her household was gutted by fire. The handover was also attended by eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda and his Deputy Philani Mavundla who also handed over homes to beneficiaries.

While there is more that needs to be done to rebuild  KZN, it is important to highlight the progress and celebrate the small wins.” She further sent gratitude to eThekwini Municipality for reaching out and ensuring that other basic needs such as water and electricity were provided. “ Thank you to eThekwini Municipality for the quick implementation of land, and water electricity in response to floods.” Mkhize was elated to introduce the alternative technology to KZN and pointed out that if people can come together a difference would be made
