For any artist, making the transition from one genre to another can be a risky step to take, but S’Villa has demonstrated how smoothly it can be done. The singer-songwriter moved from Afropop to creating an amapiano hit and proved to be a versatile artist and major talent. Sicelo Ngwenya, affectionately known as S’Villa, introduced himself to this much-loved genre with a love and dance song titled Jehovah featuring renowned artist Zuma from Amaroto. He said that collaborating with Zuma elevated the song to a beautiful delivery of music. Speaking about his latest offering, he said the song addresses the essence of love. “It is a love song and a dance song at the same time. It is about a guy who is showing his love to this lady. And he is saying to her nothing will come between them. Only Jehovah would separate us, hence its title.” Within a few months of its release, the music charts have also given the nod to his first attempt at amapiano. The Sthandwa Sami hitmaker said that people have shown great love for the single Jehovah, particularly with stunning views across various music platforms. He revealed that this big music transition was a smart move, especially for someone who started with a dance song. S’Villa also touched on his affinity for music, which he has had from a young age. The music talent is not only a phenomenal vocalist, but is also big in his writing aptitudes. He is the man behind the hit single Abantu, by Emtee and Snymaan, which received glowing reviews. Ngwenya shared that with all the pressures that come with being an artist, his defence is prayer and associating with a good circle of people. “At home or when I am with my friends I am Sicelo Ngwenya. And that keeps me grounded. And how I deal with pressure. I pray. I have a support system that advises me to always pray.”
