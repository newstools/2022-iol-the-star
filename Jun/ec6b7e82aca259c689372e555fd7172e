Though many people concede that social media plays an essential role in disseminating vital information there is also a deep-rooted belief that it has a negative impact on mental health. It is no secret that social media is contaminated with a lot of opinions and criticism that can come across as vile. In many cases celebrities fall victim to atrocious comments when they share an opinion or a picture. The only reason many choose to stay is the amount of valuable information that can be easily acquired – and there is no denying that it is a field of breaking news. Media personality Nandi Madida turned to Twitter to share how people should perceive social media and how crucial it is not to take everything that happens there to heart. “To any person struggling with social media. Social media is not necessarily real. They'll be trolls, liars, opinion makers etc. But it is paramount to understand that you cannot in any way let a make believe affect your mental health and reality. Much love.” said Madida This post was prompted by an interview in which Spanish actress Penelope Cruz revealed how she manages to keep away from social media. Somizi Mhlongo also acknowledged how detrimental these social spaces could be to one's mental state, “The Star” reported earlier this year. In a video he shared on Instagram, Mhlongo implored users to have sensitivity, to show kindness and be more understanding towards each other. “Social media is the biggest cause of suicide because of cyber-bullying because certain apps are about that. And Twitter is one of them. TikTok is now going there. TikTok is losing its fun and the purpose of why it was created,” said Mhlongo He added that Twitter was the beast of them all, to the extent that such behaviour had been normalised on the platform.
