Former Orlando Pirates player Tonic Chabalala has been granted bail. The Specialised Commercial Crimes Court in Palm Ridge, Gauteng, set his bail at R4000. He had offered to pay R3000, but the State rejected it. Chabalala, who was a spirited defender for the top flight team nicknamed the Sea Robbers, is facing charges of fraud and corruption. He allegedly defrauded the City of Joburg of R15 million through a company he ran. It has emerged that he was not a municipality employee, but a private businessman. The State alleged that Chabalala created fraudulent Requests For Quotes for companies that were awarded tenders. Some of these companies were allegedly paid twice following Chabalala's actions. He is believed to have colluded with more people, including City of Joburg employees. Spotting a maroon leather jacket, Chabalala cut a lone figure in the dock. He made his first ever appearance for the case. He paid the R4000 bail within an hour and left the court. Considered a legend at Pirates, the 43-year-old played over 150 matches for the team. He also captained the Sea Robbers. He became a professional footballer in the early 2000s, when he donned the orange jersey of the defunct Dynamos. His foundation hosted the Tonic Chabalala Annual Games in his hometown Giyani, Limpopo, a week ago. Chabalala will return to court on 12 July. @BonganiNkosi87
