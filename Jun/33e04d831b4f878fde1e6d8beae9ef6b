It seems like all the commotion whirring with Kelly Khumalo's name attached to it has not halted her career journey, as the trailer for season 3 of her much-anticipated show Life With Kelly Khumalo has just dropped. The new season launches only on Showmax on July 5, with fresh episodes every Tuesday. While the music talent has been dubbed by many names across social platforms, the new season comes with a tag that says,“ Y’all gon know about me.” It is revealed that the upcoming season will explore the raw Kelly Khumalo, as she says in the trailer: “ This is my life. This is my truth.” Those who have been following the show will see her spill the beans on how she really feels about Senzo Meyiwa’s family, Jub Jub’s Mother’s Day posts on social media, and Brenda Mtambo, as well as cancel culture. The show will also touch base on her proceeding with therapy, parenting her children, Christian and Thingo, and working on her relationships with her mother, Ntombi, and sister, Zandi. Fans will also see her working on her most anticipated album yet while growing her business empire, which already includes Controversy Gin and Kelly Khumalo Skin by Bioquantine. The Empii songstress recently celebrated the success of her SAMA-nominated album The Voice of Africa went gold, the AFRIMA-nominated Empini  became the biggest hit of her career and went quadruple platinum, Esphambanweni went double platinum, and Ngathwala Ngaye  went platinum. When The Star last spoke with Khumalo about her music success, she said her journey always had God at the helm. She also mentioned that her art was inspired by spirituality. “Spirituality is my inspiration because it opens a door to a whole lot of new information that some people do not have access to. So the more spiritual you are, the more in touch with your higher self you are. You are able to access that information which becomes a guiding light for you.”
