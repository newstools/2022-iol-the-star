Head of the ANC political school and former member of the mayoral committee in Johannesburg, Chris Vondo says after  loud cries from the people they are ready to take serious steps to rekindle the interest of taking the ANC back to the people. He pointed out that losing the municipality back in 2016 made them go back to the drawing board and evaluate themselves as a party. “The Johannesburg story is a sad one because I think the fact that we lost a municipality in 2016 was a clear indication that we are not closer to the people. 2016 gave us an opportunity to reflect and look at ourselves and self-correct,” he said Vondo said  that Johannesburg remains important to the ANC. “This is an imminent city in the world. It has occupied a very important role in the cities of the world.” Vondo also shared plans and developments underway regarding the enhancement in the visibility of historical monuments around the city. He said that they had commenced a bit of practice with all the streets that they have already renamed and work had started to take shape. He reveals their basic aim is to animate the Johannesburg CBD and have people drawn to the new changes. “The fact that the world has exceeded giving Johannesburg the responsibility of leadership in the world body level including the funding institutions. For me, it is a big big story. Now if you talk about Johannesburg in the past this was a region that used to provide leadership. Both in Gauteng and in the country. Many who were produced in Johannesburg were part of the provincial government over time.” added Vondo He said that Johannesburg has a rich political heritage and has a repository of politics. “We can't talk about the story of Johannesburg without the story of politics. We want to become the nerve centre of politics. We want to reposition Johannesburg as a nerve centre of politics.” said Vondo.
