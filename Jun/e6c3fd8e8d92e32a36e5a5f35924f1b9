ATM president Vuyo Zungula has called on young South Africans to use democratic ways to remove the ANC and President Cyril Ramaphosa out of power. Zungula who has been championing the cause to hold Ramaphosa accountable for the 4 million US dollars scandal at his Phala Phala Farm in Limpopo said it was time young people rose against corrupt liberation heroes who were depriving the youth of a successful South Africa. "The youth needs to understand that having people like Ramaphosa only means more pain and more agony. We need young people in our leadership structures," Zungula said. Zungula said despite Ramaphosa's business acumen he was still unable to create jobs for young people. He said instead young people are living on social welfare. "Under his leadership unemployment has risen and we see young people taking part in sex work. Young boys are on drugs and Gender Based Violence has risen, this is a president who does’nt care," Zungula said. Zungula said the ATM had received a response from the acting Public Protector (PP) which confirmed that the president's conduct concerning the robbery on his farm was being investigated. "We received a response that within 30 days that report will be issued. We have also written to the speaker but we have not received a response asking for a section 89 committee," Zungula said. Zungula said there was a big mystery about how such an amount of money landed in the president's hands in cash. He said if the money had come from animals that the president had sold, The president should tell the country. "The only people with such volumes of cash are CIA agents and spies. If that's the case the country has no future," Zungula said.
