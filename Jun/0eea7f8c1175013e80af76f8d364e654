Johannesburg - Veli Samuel Ngcongwane, the father of the three brothers, who succumbed after drinking “energy drinks” allegedly given by him, has died in hospital on Friday. The 39-year-old father was charged with the murder and attempted murder of his children. The brothers from Ratanda Primary School and Khanya Lesedi Secondary School in Heidelberg, Lehlogonolo Khoabane (16), Katleho Khoabane (13) and Tebogo Ngcongwane (6) were buried earlier this month. Following the brother’s death, Ngcongwane allegedly tried to kill himself and was found unconscious at the family’s home just outside Heidelberg before he was taken to hospital under police guard. The family said he took his wife's picture and after stabbing himself, placed the image on his chest. “SAPS can confirm that Veli Samuel Ngcongwane, 39-years-old, the father charged with the murder and attempted murder of his children following a poisoning incident died in hospital on June 10,” spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said.
