Johannesburg - Newly elected Johannesburg ANC chairperson, Dada Morero has pledged his support for Gauteng premier David Makhura to ascend to the ANC top six in the upcoming National Elective Congress of the party at the end of the year. In a media interview Morero said Makhura was an experienced member of the Gauteng ANC and is one of the worthiest candidates he could recommend for a position in the ANC’s top structure. “David Makhura is an asset to the ANC, he served the province for almost 22 years as secretary, as chair and deputy chair. He has the right attitude that we require of leaders of the ANC. David Makhura is one of those leaders that society has confidence in, based on his conduct and his attitude. He has a lot to offer in the ANC and to the people of this country,” Morero said. Morero was sworn in at the Johannesburg City Council this week at the leader of the party’s caucus. He said he planned on ensuring that the ANC returns to power in the City, and part of the plan was to lobby minority parties to boot out the multi-party coalition in the City. “Our conference did resolve that part of our task is to reclaim the seat of government and, of course, that would include us being effective in the opposition and expose the failure of the DA and expose the service delivery failure and we many be able to mobilise other parties in council so that we can unseat the current government. This is part of our programme,” Morero said. Morero said he was looking forward to working with the province’s newly elected chairperson, Panyaza Lesufi. He said there were no issues with alignment. Morero was the ANC regional secretary before he became chairperson at the latest regional elective conference held a few days ago. He went head-to-head with Eunice Mgcina who was the acting ANC caucus leader following the death of former regional treasurer, Mpho Moerane.
