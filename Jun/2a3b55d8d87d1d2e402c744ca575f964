Legendary poet and activist Mzwakhe Mbuli has accused the National Prosecuting Authority of being corrupt and protecting a foreign national who nearly killed him. Mbuli said he was shocked to find out that the NPA had withdrawn a case against a Somali national who had crashed into Mbuli's Volkswagen outside the SABC last August, It was not clear if the driver was injured.  But Mbuli said he was simply told there was lack of evidence.  "After a long wait for Justice or court date. On the 31st May I received a whatsapp text from Warrant Officer Walaza that Cas 01/11/2021 Ref 1335 has been withdrawn, This is not acceptable but a rotten decision by rotten elements who are not fit to be within NPA," Mbuli said Mbuli said what upset him was that the man who had crashed into him had tried to bribe him to let go of the case. "The guy who crushed me was an uber driver operating in Mayfair. His Somalia boss came and offered to pay me, he persisted until we were at Brixton police Station," Mbuli said. Mbuli said after his case was withdrawn he then contacted senior officials in SAPS and the NPA to complain about the matter. The Star can confirm that the office of the National Director of Public Prosecution (NDPP) has placed that matter back on the court roll and the suspect will be once again charged with reckless and negligent driving. A new court date was expected to be set.
