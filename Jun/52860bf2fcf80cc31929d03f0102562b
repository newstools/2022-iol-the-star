To celebrate culture, lifestyle and creative minds that come from the local cities in Mzansi, the world's second-largest Scotch whisky brand, Ballantine’s has shown up for authenticity through their global digital campaign, Stay True Cities. This year, the Ballantine’s “Stay True Cities” spotlights the much-loved Amapiano duo Mellow and Sleazy, by celebrating the extraordinary sounds and impact their home-towns have on their music. With this campaign, the “Nkao Tempela” hit-makers celebrate the ever-evolving amapiano sounds through their experiences as they seek to create a global mark in the industry through their music. The famous music duo revealed that they were elated to have been given such an opportunity to have their fans know more about their artistry. “We are super excited for this opportunity as it's a chance for our fans to get to know us better. Shooting the film was cool because we got to hang out at our favourite spots with the ‘Stay True Cities’ team. They were super cool and supportive, experiencing that was an honour and we’re thankful for the opportunity. We hope our fans enjoy it. Bacardi to the world!" Mellow and Sleazy said. Ballantine’s took to the streets of Ga-Rankuwa and Soshanguve to experience and showcase the grassroots of Mellow and Sleazy as they pay homage to the sounds that influenced the unique fusion of Amapiano and Bacardi sounds that this dynamic duo creates. The Ballantine’s “Stay True Cities: A Blend From the North” film showcases the richness of Pretoria sounds, highlighted through featured interviews with friends, neighbours and local residents of Ga-Rankuwa and Soshanguve. Throughout the film, Mellow and Sleazy open up about their music journey and how they blend their sounds together. They also mention what motivated them to become the dynamic duo they are today.
