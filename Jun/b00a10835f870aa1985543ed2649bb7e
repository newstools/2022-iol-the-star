Johannesburg - The City of Joburg Member of the Mayoral Committee for Housing Mlungisi Mabaso has warned members of the public to be wary of fraudsters who are allegedly promising them RDP houses in Lufhereng, south of Johannesburg. This came after fake posters circulated on social media calling on people who applied for houses to come forward and be allocated this month. According to the Housing Department, the poster said there are about 420 houses ready for allocation in Greater Lufhereng from Monday, June 20 to Thursday, June 30. “I wish to indicate that this is yet another fraudulent attempt aimed at scamming and soliciting money from people who need houses. I urge the residents not to fall for it. There will be no housing allocations in Lufhereng this month,” said Mabaso. He added that the department was making strides at ensuring the City provided people with decent houses and that Lufhereng is one of its major projects and a number of residents will benefit from it soon. “In coming months, we will communicate with deserving beneficiaries once we are ready to allocate via official channels such as our regional offices and the Housing website”, Mabaso said. “I also wish to reiterate that we will not tolerate criminality in the name of the department.” Meanwhile, in February, three suspects were arrested for allegedly creating fake social media accounts in MMC Mabaso’s name to solicit money from unsuspecting people who want houses and promise to give them RDP houses in exchange for cash.
