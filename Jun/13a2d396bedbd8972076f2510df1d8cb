Popular music talents YoungstaCPT and Raf Don have made a return with a song dubbed “Tekky” which delves into the sneakrer culture and how it aims to connect people from different backgrounds. With sneakers known as cultural commodities globally, the duo also wanted to make their mark on the hip-hop industry while also representing Cape Town’s sneaker culture through this new offering. Speaking about the song Raf Don said, “YoungstaCPT and I wanted to find a way to connect with people from different cultural backgrounds, races and classes, and this was the perfect way to do that because of the common love and interest in sneakers, which also inspired the title of the song but using the colloquial term Tekky.” They revealed that no matter what part of Cape Town people can visit, even in the poor communities, one can get traces of sneaker culture, with people owning one-of-a-kind Jordan’s or Air Forces because of their liking of sneakers. “Our sneakers are a part of our identity because through our sneakers we can make a statement,” explained Raf Don. YoungstaCPT also commented, “YGen? and I share a love for both hip hop and sneakers and it is that love that motivated us to start a sneaker store in Wynberg, Cape Town. That reflects who we are, and it is like inviting people into our world and showing them why sneaker culture is so important to us and the Cape Town community,” said YoungstaCPT. The song is also dubbed “Drill”, an emerging hip hop sound in Africa, particularly in Cape Town. The sound began in Chicago and made its way to New York and the UK and now people across Africa and South Africa are embracing the sound.  The music talents said it was important for the sound to reflect what the song was about, and the “Drill Movement” had influenced how the sneaker culture was perceived and understood.
