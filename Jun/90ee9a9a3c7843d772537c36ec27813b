Johannesburg - Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo (JCPZ) is aiming to secure a large-scale fully-funded private sector partnership to create more vibrant, green, safe and sustainable public parks in the City, over a multi-year period. “No longer is the dependency solely with the government to mitigate climate change. Joburg needs an alliance with the private sector to offset our carbon footprint, to create a livable city,” said the Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC) for Community Development Ronald Harris. The power of greening to address environmental and socio-economic challenges, and the associated benefits for partners will be explored at the city’s inaugural ‘Action Imbizo’ scheduled for Thursday in Sandton. In partnership with the Johannesburg Parks Alliance (JPA), JCPZ together with partners is expected to present fully funded projects and exemplars that will contribute towards the safe and sustainable green public open spaces. JCPZ said these projects will be monitored and evaluated as they are being implemented over the next 12 months, allowing the projects to be viable use cases that can be replicated in other communities across Johannesburg. “This ground-breaking initiative during World Environment Month and Youth month in South Africa offers the city an incredible opportunity to reimagine the city’s green public open spaces as well as ensure that our youth will have a lasting legacy of green public open spaces,” Harris said.
