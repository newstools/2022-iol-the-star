The countdown has begun ahead of the much-anticipated National Arts Festival which is set to kick off on June 23. The National Jazz Festival Makhanda will once again unite jazz musicians from across the country and the world at SA’s definitive jazz gathering, live at the National Arts Festival. Jazz has always been an essential part of the National Arts Festival and this year the festival guarantees to be a big drawcard for audiences who have missed the live experience of jazz as a result of Covid-19. The programme is packed with a strong line-up of younger jazz artists and, although the headlines are filled with young South African jazz artists, excellent musicians from Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Romania, Britain, and Spain will be collaborating with them for this very special celebration of jazz. National Arts Festival CEO, Monica Newton said: “It’s a much-needed reunion for jazz musicians who will once again gather together to jam, collaborate and share. “With a big focus on local talent and local jazz excellence, the 35th National Jazz Festival Makhanda has assembled an exciting programme of artists from across SA. “Our celebration of jazz this year is bitter-sweet; as musicians once again take to the stage of the Festival to engage with live audiences for the first time in two years; we will also be remembering and celebrating lives lost during the pandemic.” The Jazz Festival also includes an essential programme that is key to the development of professional jazz musicians in South Africa. The National Youth Jazz Festival brings together talented, young musicians from across South Africa and through the programme, some 300 plus young musicians from schools, universities and informal institutions around the country are able to meet and connect with successful and diverse jazz musicians.
