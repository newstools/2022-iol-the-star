Johannesburg - The launch ceremony for the Education Changemakers leadership training programme took place on Monday morning at University of South Africa (Unisa) Graduate School of Business Leadership in Midrand. The programme is an investment by the YALI Regional Leadership Centre Southern Africa (YALI RLC-SA) and the Trevor Noah Foundation, in a new generation of young leaders in the education sector. According to UNISA, 50 young leaders from 14 countries across Southern Africa were welcomed to this programme to build robust leadership skills. The young education changemakers will be provided with a network of support and resources, as they transform their schools and communities. The programme includes two phases which include, participants completing four weeks of intensive leadership training applying business and public management tools for the education sector, followed by six months of post-graduate coaching and mentoring. Unisa said the four-week programme will be housed at the Unisa Graduate School of Business Leadership (Unisa SBL) in Midrand from 27 June – 22 July 2022. For the Trevor Noah Foundation, the Education Changemakers programme is an acknowledgement that educators play a critical role in inspiring and cultivating our next generation of leaders. “For me, I’ve come to realise the secret is great teachers. In my life and the lives of many other kids, one great teacher has made all the difference,” said chairperson Trevor Noah. The Star
