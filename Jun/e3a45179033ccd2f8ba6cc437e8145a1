Musicians Chicco Twala and Owen Ndlovu have joined forces with other artists to compose a song titled ‘Izikhukhula’ in the hope of raising R15 million to assist the victims of the KwaZulu-Natal floods. Ndlovu, who is the executive producer and founder of the initiative, said one of the conventional ways Africans use to honour any situation is through music. With  ‘Izikhukhula’ there is a profound message directed to those who are victims and gives comfort to their ordeal, he said.  “We thought let’s sit down and come up with a song that will comfort the people. We believe the song we came up with is a good song to support people who are going through hard emotions right now. “We will never know the extent of their loss, and we can only imagine what they are going through right now. For me this is more than just social responsibility but an act of Ubuntu. We are not expecting gains from this more than we want to help the affected families,” Ndlovu said. Twala said: “We will work hand-in-hand with the KZN government to ensure serving families get help.” This is not the first topical song the two have composed. Ndlovu said some of their songs challenge societal affairs. They are also delighted with the positive response to the song and urge people to download it and stream the it on various platforms.
