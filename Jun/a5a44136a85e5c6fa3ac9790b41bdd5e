Johannesburg - Pharmaceutical company Cipla, in collaboration with the SA Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), is recalling specific batches of Coryx Throat Spray from the market due to a faulty mechanism. Customers who purchased products from the listed batches below have been urged to return them to their pharmacy for a full refund. The batches numbers and expiry dates of Coryx Throat Spray (registration number W/16.3/58) that need to be recalled include: ZB000156 (Expiry: 10.2022), ZB000157 (Expiry: 10.2022), ZB000158 (Expiry: 10.2022), ZB000159 (Expiry: 10.2022), ZB000160 (Expiry: 10.2022), ZB100105 (Expiry: 02.2023), ZB100107 (Expiry: 02.2023), ZB100172 (Expiry: 02.2023), ZB100173 (Expiry: 02.2023). The reason for the product recall is due to the possibility of the spray nozzle detaching from the spray mechanism during use, and possibly resulting in the spray nozzle being ingested or getting stuck in the throat after detaching. “The safety and well-being of our patients is our utmost priority. Therefore, after liaising with SAHPRA, it was deemed necessary to recall specific batches of this product from the market. We are working closely with spray mechanism manufacturers to ensure there is no margin for error in future,” said Cipla chief executive Paul Miller. The Star
