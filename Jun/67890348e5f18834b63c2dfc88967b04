On Friday The Star reported that Fraser had handed over voice recordings, videos, photos and even emails deeply proving  Ramaphosa’s hand in corruption. Twitter user Manyako Pando Achar wrote: “I suspect it had Frazer all over it and had to edit him out before he release more about them” Another user and lawyer, Mothibi Phosa wrote: “ I'm sure there are ongoing consultations among the three arms of the state - legislature, executive and judiciary - regarding the timing and possibly even contents of the report.
