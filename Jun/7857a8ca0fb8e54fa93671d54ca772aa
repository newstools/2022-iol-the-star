Businesswoman, Tsakani Mkhari, has started an initiative called, Raising Legends, to  help in curbing the scourge of Gender-Based Violence Against Women and children. She pioneered the initiative to give young boys a platform to be open about the challenges facing them in their daily lives.  Not only does the initiative support young boys but also celebrates those who are making a difference in their communities. The 38-year-old highlighted the importance of equipping young boys with life skills at an early age. “It will not take a day or a hashtag to teach a grown man how to treat a woman right if he was not taught from a young age. Making noise and creating hashtags whenever we have a victim of GBV will not uproot this demon. We have a duty to take care of our boys, they matter,” Mkhari said Mkhari explains: ”Raising Legends is an initiative aimed at supporting,  embracing,  grooming and giving a boy child and young men in general - a platform to address day to day challenges facing them. Men face the struggles as (do) women if not more.” She added that it was important to give support to young boys in the same way as girls. “We have initiatives that take a girl child to school and empower her, which is not wrong. The same thing must be done for a boy child so that the two can co-exist. We saw the need to put interventions in place, groom and support a boy child, while also celebrating those men who are making a difference in their different community.” Mkhari said they were in a quest to rolling out schools of life at over 30 schools in Tzaneen, the Collins Chabane Municipality and Gauteng.  This year’s 5th Raising Legends Awards ceremony will be held on June 25 at the Royal Khalanga Lodge, Nwamitwa outside Tzaneen.
