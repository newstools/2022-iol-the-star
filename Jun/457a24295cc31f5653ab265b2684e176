It has become a norm for Father's day to turn into a dramatic day on social media whether the subject is about deadbeat fathers being attacked or random trolls on who should post who on this special day. As most women have been raving about men who are incredible fathers to their children, DJ Zinhle also joined the club sending an appreciation to both fathers of her two kids AKA and Black Motion’s Murdah Bongz. Zinhle shared a snap of AKA carrying their daughter Kairo Forbes and wrote, “Happy Father's Day” on her Twitter account. It was not long after the Umlilo hitmaker had her post bombarded by criticism with many questioning how the person she is currently in a relationship with felt. This caused a divide on social media as other Tweeps fully understood the depth and essence of co-operating regardless of being in a relationship with someone else while for others was found it unbecoming . This also brought the hot subject of whether it is appropriate to post someone you are not in a relationship with but share a child with on occasions like Mother's Day or Father's day. Dj Zinhle is currently in an envy-worthy relationship with Black Motion’s Bongani who she shares their daughter Asante. The pair have been loved up and  inseparable since they made their relationship public while AKA is also in a fresh relationship with the rapper Nadia Nakai. This is not the first time this caused a stir on social media, when the rapper praised Zinhle on Mother’s Day, he simply dubbed it as an act of being “mature”. He clapped back at the criticism and said, “ It's called...maturity. Being an adult. Try it. It's lit. “ he said.
