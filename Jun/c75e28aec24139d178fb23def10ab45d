As statistics enlist the high unemployment rate among the youth as one of the grave ills pervasive in South Africa, Metropolitan has made its mark to combat unemployment. In efforts to assist young people to push through this widespread calamity, Metropolitan has partnered with Uber and pioneered a campaign called We’re Here for You(th). With transport and proper clothing counted as one of the major setbacks that negatively affect young people in the job-seeking pursuit this collaboration has been giving youth candidates the ability to commute to and from job interviews in June and July for free. Metropolitan has also been dressing and preparing the youth for success, by providing them with clothing vouchers and interview tips to ensure the youth put their best foot forward on interview day. The Star spoke to the Youth Employment head at Momentum Metropolitan Nkosinathi Mahlangu who touched base on the essence of this campaign. Mahlangu said this campaign was brought to life with the commemoration of youth month but they planned to stretch it further “The campaign is focused on the youth as we are commemorating youth month, so as Metropolitan we have partnered with Uber to provide 500 Uber vouchers to young people who are said to be going to their job interviews.” He added that these efforts were aimed at giving young people an opportunity to show up for those interviews and have one less thing to worry about. “Commuting for some young people is a big problem as some of them use more than one bus to reach their interview destinations. So for this initiative, we are trying to ensure that young people do not have to worry about transport arrangements as they move from home to the interview and back again,” he shared. Mahlangu also revealed that they had gone through all the necessary verification processes to ensure the veracity of every request made. We’re here for You(th) campaign aims to give young people a chance to reach their highest potential.
