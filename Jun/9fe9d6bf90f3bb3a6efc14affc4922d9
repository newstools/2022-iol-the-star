ANC Limpopo provincial chairperson Stanley Mathabatha has raised grave concerns regarding the party revealing that some incompatible actions are the result of the withdrawal of support from people. He detailed that ANC will be a sinking ship if its members do not rectify all the grave ills that are prevalent in the country that have made many lose confidence  in them. Delivering his political report at one of the 10th provincial conferences he emphasised that they need to stop being the enemy of the people. Mabatha said  there has been no visible improvement in the ANC claiming that the party needs to be rescued. According to reports Mathabatha said their display of luxurious lifestyles while people are suffering from deprivation is itself a form of failure. “A strange phenomenon has erupted in the movement where ANC leaders are associated with lavish living and exorbitance. The ANC cannot afford the tag of being elite politicians who wallow in lavish lifestyles and live in affluent suburbs whilst the people we lead gallop in the sea of poverty and dusty streets.” “We cannot have leaders with a [zeal] to flaunt money and naked material consumption in the face of the poor masses we lead.” Commenting on negative tendencies which contribute largely to their image as an organisation he pointed out that, “ The ANC must live and outlive all of us. The reality of the matter is that the ANC must be rescued from the grip of these negative tendencies.There is no doubt that the ANC is faced with an expiry of time if we do not do anything. We need to renew the movement or face the real possibility of the death of the ANC.” A few hours ago Mathabatha accepted the nomination, standing for re-election for the third term for the position of chairperson.
