The Special Investigations Unit has welcomed the arrest of three men including a high ranking government official who were involved in PPE fraud and corruption worth over R5.9 million. Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Deputy Director Raymond Manzini, his brother Chris Manzini and director of Gatjeni Trading Moses Ndlovu were arrested by the Hawks in Mbombela on Monday, 30 May 2022.  They appeared at the Mbombela Magistrate Court on charges of fraud and corruption. The trio were released on R15 000 bail each and the matter was remanded to 28 July 2022 for further investigation. SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said SIU investigation in the Cogta department revealed that Gatjeni Trading was solely requested to quote for the supply and delivery of PPE in March 2020. However, after the PPE contract was awarded, Ndlovu approached Chris Manzini to take over the purchase without the approval of the department. "SIU investigation further revealed that Chris Manzini, also approached his brother Raymond Manzini, who is a government official, provides funding for the purchase and delivery of PPE. Raymond Manzini allegedly financed the purchase, in  contravention of the provisions of Prevention and Combating Corrupt Activities  Act 12 of 2004," Kgamyago said. Gatjeni Trading handed an invoice to Raymond Manzini, the financial provider, for  the Department to effect payment. Immediately after payment was received, a  significant sum of money was transferred to Raymond Manzini’s bank account.
