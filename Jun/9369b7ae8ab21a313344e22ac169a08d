Exactly 30 border posts that were closed following the Covid-19 outbreak remained closed due to a lack of health officials. Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi insisted in a written reply to parliament questions that his hands were tied insofar as the reopening of the borders was concerned. “Enforcement of Health protocols remains a critical requirement and with the absence of that capability the border posts cannot be reopened,” he said. DA MP Adrian Roos asked Motsoaledi for the name of each of the border posts that remain closed after they were closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 30 border posts that Motsoaledi mentioned included Ramatsidiso,  Makhaleng, Makgobistad, Sendelingsdrift, Onseepkans, Rietfontein, Middelsputs, McCarthy’s Rest, Makopong and Bray. Giriyondo, Josefsdal, Nerston, Emahlathini, Bothashoop, Nerston, Waverley, Onverwacht, Monontshapass and Pekabridge also remained closed. All these border posts were located between South Africa and Lesotho, Namibia, Mozambique and eSwatini. Pilanesberg International Airport, located in the North West province, was the only airport named by Motsoaledi. Roos asked what steps were being taken to reopen the border posts.  Motsoaledi replied: “The reopening of each border post is dependent on the Department of Health. Asked about the estimated time frame for reopening of each border post, Motsoaledi replied: “This is dependent on the Department of Health.” @BonganiNkosi87
