Staff Reporter  After a very controversial delay where political parties have raised red flags about the delays in its release, the Zondo Commission report has ignored glaring evidence presented on Bosasa, Eskom and Glencore and every other evidence that may have seen to link President Cyril Ramaphosa to corruption. The commission has ignored the three applications by former Intelligence head Arthur Frazer to present evidence and has not reported a single sentence on the evidence of former Eskom CEO’s Brian Molefe, Matshela Koko Prasa CEO Lucky Montana. Among other serious allegations, Molefe accused Ramaphosa of being at the cause of load shedding because at the time Glencore sold substandard coal to Eskom, Ramaphosa was Chair of Glencore, head of government business and the deputy president of Republic. His role at Glencore was a conflict of interest to that of  head of government business. Interestingly, the commission has noted nothing about the written evidence by Free State officials about Ramaphosa’s involvement in Shanduka. In Chief Justice Raymond Zondo’s words “Ramaphosa saved the country”.
