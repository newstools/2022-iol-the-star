Multi-award-winning rapper Focalistic has touched down in South Africa after a successful tour in the US and has events lined up to grace them with his stellar performances. His recent tour included dates in Atlanta, San Diego and New York City. Lethabo Sebetso, fondly known as Focalistic, also has tours booked for Canada and Australia later this year. The “Ke Star” hitmaker is fired up after his recent spectacular collaboration with global Afrobeat star Davido (with Abidoza) on CKay’s new fire single, “Watawi”. Among many places which he will grace this week, Focalistic will be a special guest along with Tumisho and Kmat at the BudXLab at the Venue Thirteen Rooftop Bar. From June 22 to July, Budweiser will be presenting Mixmag Lab, a long line of interesting events that music lovers can look forward to. This is in keeping with the thrilling performances and surprises of the past three weeks which have featured the likes of international DJs Mo Black and Jamie, local star DJ Heavy K and an unforgettable all-female line-up headlined by Desiree. The series of 10 parties, which started in May and will continue until July, has reignited the Joburg dance scene culture with an exciting line-up of incredible acts. Budweiser Africa Zone marketing manager Khwezi Vika spoke about BudXLab. “The BudXLab series brings a special touch to South Africa’s dance music culture. Along with international guests, it’s exciting to show just why South Africans are producing some of the world’s best dance music right now. The global stage is ours to take and the BudXLab series is making clubbing history.” All is in keeping with the epic dance music history of The Lab, a flagship series that has presented legendary electronic music sets from the likes of Carl Cox, The Martinez Brothers, Disclosure, Black Coffee, Charlotte De Witte, and Alison Wonderland over the years. The Lab has taken place in iconic cities around the world, from London to Goa to New York and LA.
