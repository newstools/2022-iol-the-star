She has decided to use all her tumultuous experiences and turn them into beautiful music art. Local music sensation Nanette Mbili – fondly known as Nanette – has delivered a heartfelt R&B album titled “Bad Weather”, in which she speaks candidly about her ordeals throughout her life. Going through some bumpy phases in her life not only gave birth to this album, but made her see that the storm was not permanent. In our conversation with Nanette, she spoke about the inspiration behind the album. “The album was inspired by the feeling of being in a thunderstorm alone, a fear that I had when I was a child.  “I wanted to take that fear and attach it to everything else that I was scared of at that time, and that I have gone through. And sort of write an album about that thunderstorm in my life.” she shared. The music bug caught Nanette when she was just 8-years old, and joining choirs played a crucial part in honing her skills. Mbili shared that she gravitated a lot towards R&B because of how it allowed her to be candid about her sentiments. Asked about what inspired her music, she said experiences “inspires my art”. “Things I have seen… It is my deepest thoughts and it is also about the society we live in now. It is all of that put together. I think that is why I love R&B so much.  “It is one of the few genres that allow you to be open and candid about your content. It is not just about love, but a genre that is vulnerable… Where you can talk about anything.” The KwaZulu-Natal-born talent said she wanted her music to feel authentic when people listened to it and could relate. She said being surrounded by a decent team played a significant part in how she dealt with the pressures pervasive in the entertainment industry. “I am so grateful that they help me deal with the pressure. They are always assuring me and believing in me… They always treat me like I am already the biggest artist in the world,” she said.
