The Miss South Africa organisation has revealed its top 10 hopefuls vying for the coveted Miss SA title. The beauty queens are Anarzade Omar, Ayanda Thabethe, Itumeleng Parage, Keaoleboga Nkashe,  Lebogang Mahlangu, Luvé Meyer, Luyanda Zuma, Ndavi Nokeri, Pearl Ntshehi and Tamsyn Jack. Whoever is crowned will represent the country on the global stage and will take over the reigns from Lalela Mswane. All the contestants said they were elated to have been granted the opportunity to go further in the competition. One of the finalists is Luyanda Zuma, an international model, entrepreneur and  final year Bachelor of Live Performance student at Afda.  Zuma said of the experience: “I am thrilled to have made the Top 10. I struggled with self-acceptance when I grew up and being put into a certain category that I didn’t want to be in. It took a lot for me to love myself and show others that it’s possible to follow your dreams and chase your heart. There must be something in the water in Maritzburg.” Anarzade Omar, who has a BA in Strategic Communication in Marketing from the University of Johannesburg and works as a social media manager at a digital marketing agency, also remarked about making it to the top 10. “This has always been my goal and I was determined to get my spot in the final,” she said. “I honestly believe this is my purpose and that it is worth fighting for.” All the beauty queens will face off at Sun international’s flagship venue, the SunBet Arena at Time Square in Pretoria, on August 13, where the winner will be crowned Miss South Africa 2022.
