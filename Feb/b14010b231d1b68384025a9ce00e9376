We were forced to move out of Clare Estate about four years ago, mainly because of the potholes. We also moved because of the increasing growth rate of informal settlements nearly encroaching on the already terrible roads. By moving to a “classier” area like Musgrave, albeit at a much greater living cost, we imagined that with the higher quality of services we would also be rubbing shoulders with a better quality of people. Alas! In spite of a few retirement homes in St Thomas and Vause roads, no enforcement against speeding vehicles is visible. Classy area means people of a better mentality? No, not here. There are some idiotic spoilt brats of all races who must have been devoid of motherly love at some stage and now, as compensation, seek public attention by revving their parents’ hard-bought eight cylinders to near ring-breaking point, damaging our ears and scaring the pistons out of people in the retirement homes, and even young people who have just knocked off night shift and are simply seeking a quiet day’s sleep. I am surprised metro police have not received complaints from these retirement homes and from people who are probably working from home. These underage denizens from spoilt homes must be captured and put away, their cars impounded and their over-age parents charged for being so reckless as to bring such vermin into this world.
