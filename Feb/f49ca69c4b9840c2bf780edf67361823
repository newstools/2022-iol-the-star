CAPE TOWN - The NSPCA has welcomed a court ruling it says is the biggest legal win for reptiles in South Africa’s history, which will have a lasting impact in future cases of cruelty. In 2019, the NSPCA received a tip-off regarding an individual who was illegally housing snakes in a warehouse in Rustenburg and participating in the illegal activity of feeding live animals as prey.  Under a warrant the NSPCA’s inspectors noted several alleged transgressions, including injuries that were left untreated, that the animals were underweight, and the snakes had burn wounds from incorrect lighting. Live rabbits were also allegedly being fed to the snakes. “Three southern African pythons were removed from the property by the NSPCA, as well as all the rabbits. The pythons were taken to the Johannesburg Wildlife Veterinary Hospital for treatment, and the rabbits were rehomed to loving families by the SPCA. “The NSPCA initiated the prosecution of those involved in the abuse of the animals and yesterday, after two years of the NSPCA following up on the case, finally justice was served “The Honourable Magistrate Maboho found all the accused guilty of the charges the NSPCA presented and sentenced them to the following: R50 000 fine for each of the accused or five years’ imprisonment. “R80 000 was awarded to JHB Wildlife Veterinary Hospital for their costs incurred in treating the pythons, and R5 000 (was awarded) for the costs incurred by the NSPCA for travelling to and from court for the duration of this case. “This judgment has gone on to become the biggest legal win for reptiles in South African history and will have a lasting impact in future cases of cruelty involving reptiles. "The accused parties are denied ever owning or being in charge of reptiles or rabbits again in the future," the NSPCA said.  Cape Times
