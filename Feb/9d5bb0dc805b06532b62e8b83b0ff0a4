Durban – Fifteen goats trapped on rocks in the middle of the rapidly flowing Umzinyathi River in Nquthu were safely rescued by police search and rescue units. Nquthu is in the Umzinyathi District Municipality in northern KwaZulu-Natal. A statement issued by police on Tuesday said members of Empangeni Search and Rescue and Newcastle and Vryheid K9 Search and Rescue were involved in the operation. Police said the 15 goats were brought to safety after they were found stranded on a rock formation in the Umzinyathi River in Nquthu. “Members set up a rope system and made use of a rescue Stokes basket to ferry the goats to safety,” said police.    Last week IOL reported that 35 wild horses, including three foals, were rescued after they were trapped on islands along the flooded Orange River in the Northern Cape. According to the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) Port Nolloth station commander, Hugo Foot, the horses were scattered in groups across a number of smaller islands on which they had sought shelter. He said as islands were flooded, the horses were forced to swim to the next island, causing the horses to be scattered over a large area. Some were standing on islands that were already submerged. “The horses were corralled and walked through chest-deep water and at places swam through water to reach larger islands,” said Foot.
