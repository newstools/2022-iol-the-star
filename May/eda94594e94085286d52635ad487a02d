JOHANNESBURG – A traditional healer and his son have been arrested in connection with the death of Bontle Mashiyane, who is believed to have been killed in an alleged muti ritual. Samuel Makebeletane Tsela, 63, and his son Philasande Tsela, 28, appeared in the Kabokweni Magistrate's Court on Tuesday facing charges of kidnapping, rape and murder. Three other suspects appeared in court the day before. “The two will join ex-convict Collen Hlongwane, 36, Thapelo Ngomane, 25, and Ntombi Mgwenya, 40, who appeared in court on Monday,” said Mpumalanga Provincial SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala. All the suspects abandoned bail and were remanded in custody. Their next appearance will be at Masoyi Periodical Court on June 24. Mashiyane was reported missing on April 3. Her decomposed body was discovered at Mganduzweni, near White River, on May 21, with some body parts missing. One of the suspects, Ngomane, confessed in a video recording, detailing how they dismembered Mashiyane’s body and removed her womb and her knees with Philasande Tsele. “For another child a sangoma paid R45 000 for body parts and for Mashiyane we were given R20 000. I don’t know the buyer but I have met his son Philasande, who told us what was needed and we gave him. “Me and another man have slaughtered three children. I can’t dismember the body, the other guy is the one who can do that. I can kidnap only, but can’t slaughter a human being,” said Ngomane. He said there were other children’s bodies that had been recovered, and that they had given the body parts to the sangoma. He said wombs were in demand. NPA confirmed that the suspects had applied for legal aid representatives. The Star
