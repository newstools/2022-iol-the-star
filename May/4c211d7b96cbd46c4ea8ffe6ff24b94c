Durban - Members of the SANDF are using drones to aid relief efforts in KwaZulu-Natal, following April's heavy rains and flooding. Captain Tshegofatso Gwai said the South African Army Intelligence Corps members, detached from the Engineer Squadron, under Joint Tactical Headquarters KwaZulu-Natal, are providing technological support to the operation through drones. “Due to some areas being inaccessible because of the extensive damage caused by the floods and the province’s generally challenging terrain, drones have been brought in to help gather intelligence on damaged areas,” Gwai said. “The retrieved photographic data provides valuable information about what areas require support to the reconnaissance team and the collected data forms part of the assessment report, after which the engineers’ tasking is approved,” said Gwai. Gwai said that the drones were operated by an enthusiastic and dedicated crew, under the command of Lieutenant Bafana Shepherd Mtshaise. “Drones reach mostly where most photographic lenses can’t reach. This is evident in how drone technology improves the livelihoods of many communities affected by floods,” Gwai said. Daily News
