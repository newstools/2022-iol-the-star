Dutch - South African singer-songwriter Joya Mooi shares interesting details about her music journey, her first performance in South Africa, and music projects on the cards. Mooi told The Star about her debut performance in South Africa, which she also identifies as her biggest highlight as a musician. “Honestly I think this is the biggest highlight. I have never performed in SA and this is my first time.” The star from Amsterdam revealed that she usually came to South Africa as a visitor and further described her performance experiences here as “incredible”. Having her family witness her do what she is passionate about was also a delightful experience for Mooi. Asked what made her decide to perform in SA, she said: “ It is my second home. I come here every year if there is no Covid-19 situation. So I really wanted to bring my love for my family in my second home together with my passion, which is music.” Mooi showcased her soothing vocals at the Feel Good Series in Joburg this past weekend and will be at Selective Styles in Cape Town in a few days. The Blossom Carefully musician said that while growing up she was shy about telling her parents about her singing talent. When she was 13, she summoned the courage to eventually tell them. And that was the start of her singing. “I think I was seven when I started playing a saxophone because my father plays trumpet, so we would play together. Also, I was shy to tell my parents that I wanted to sing, so saxophone was my gateway. And then when I was 13 I said to my parents, I am ready.” The Most Frail singer explored her singing abilities through performances and creating more music. Mooi further said she has music on the horizon that people should be on the look out for.
