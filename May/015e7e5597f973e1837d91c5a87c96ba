JOHANNESBURG – Nolan Pillay, who is the chief executive of a non-profit organisation, Be the BEST version of YOURSELF Foundation, is on a quest to raise funds to help assist the deaf community. These funds will allow the team to climb and summit Mt Kilimanjaro in August, fund cochlear implants and hearing aids for children born deaf and have workshops to bridge the gap between the deaf and hearing communities. As part of their fundraising campaign, they are hosting a Charity Golf Day  on July 1. This campaign supports the Climb4TheDeaf Challenge that is set to take place in August, where he will climb Mt Kilimanjaro with four other members. He says when he started to put the climb together he knew it would spark conversations within both the deaf and the hearing community. Pillay aims to bridge the gap between hearing and deaf communities. Asked what the whole initiative means to him he said: “To me personally, when the late Khethiwe Madi spoke at the launch of my company StraightTalkWithNolan, she asked me and my audience ‘what if all of you cannot hear and I am the only one who can hear, who is the one with the disability?’ “This struck a chord in me and I realised then and there that I needed to do something to bridge the gap between the hearing and deaf communities.” Climbing a mountain is not an easy task particularly for someone who communicates via speech. Pillay opened up about how challenging it is to witness hearing people shun a deaf person because of their communication barrier. “One of the challenges I am witnessing is that hearing people tend to ignore deaf people because they cannot communicate with them. “I am trying to enforce that irrespective of any disability, the person is still a human and needs to be treated as a human.” He also hopes that more people become part of this meaningful campaign. They welcome people who are willing to sponsor them. The Star
