Muluka-Anne Miti-Drummond a UN Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with Albinism says there was a concern that during political elections in most African countries there was a spike in attacks of people living with albinism. The UN expert was speaking at the launch of a report that focused on ritual attacks on children in Africa. The report shows that every year, thousands of African children are accused of witchcraft and suffer ritual attacks, abuse, physical and psychological violence, yet most governments are turning a blind eye.  Witchcraft accusations and ritual attacks against African children are hidden and ignored, yet are one of the most gruesome forms of violence against children. Miti-Drummond said there was evidence of a growing market for body parts in Africa including South Africa. She refused to disclose lucrative the markets were but said there was evidence that the markets were trading with huge amounts of money. "We have not uncovered the markets as such but we have uncovered evidence which points to the existence of a market. We have had cases of individuals attempting to sell body parts and they have been arrested while attempting to sell body parts in the wrong markets," Miti-Drummond said. Miti-Drummond said in many cases  those who took part in the body part trade were compelled by poverty and in some instances they would sacrifice their own family members. "In 2017 we had one case in South Africa where a traditional healer was arrested for commissioning body parts. This is a case where we had the person sourcing the body parts being arrested.  There are spikes in attacks on people with albinism during political elections as well this also indicates the existence of a market," Miti-Drummond said.
